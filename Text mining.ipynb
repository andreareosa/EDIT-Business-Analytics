      "{'Charlie_Parker': '\\nUnited Kingdom: Esquire\\nCharles Parker Jr. (August 29, 1920 – March 12, 1955), nicknamed \"Bird\" and \"Yardbird\", was an American jazz saxophonist and composer.[1] Parker was a highly influential soloist and leading figure in the development of bebop,[2] a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique, and advanced harmonies. Parker was a blazingly fast virtuoso and introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas into jazz, including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. Primarily a player of the alto saxophone, Parker\\'s tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber.\\nParker acquired the nickname \"Yardbird\" early in his career on the road with Jay McShann.[3] This, and the shortened form \"Bird\", continued to be used for the rest of his life, inspiring the titles of a number of Parker compositions, such as \"Yardbird Suite\", \"Ornithology\", \"Bird Gets the Worm\", and \"Bird of Paradise\". Parker was an icon for the hipster subculture and later the Beat Generation, personifying the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual rather than just an entertainer.[4]\\nCharlie Parker Jr. was born in Kansas City, Kansas, at 852 Freeman Avenue, and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, near Westport and later – in high school – near 15th and Olive Street. He was the only child of Charles Parker and Adelaide \"Addie\" Bailey, who was of mixed Choctaw and African-American background.[5] He attended Lincoln High School[6] in September 1934, but withdrew in December 1935, just before joining the local musicians\\' union and choosing to pursue his musical career full-time.[7] His childhood sweetheart and future wife, Rebecca Ruffin, graduated from Lincoln High School in June 1935.\\nParker began playing the saxophone at age 11, and at age 14 he joined his high school band where he studied under Bandmaster Alonzo Lewis. His mother purchased a new alto saxophone around the same time. His father, Charles Sr., was often required to travel for work, but provided some musical influence because he was a pianist, dancer and singer on the Theater Owners Booking Association (T.O.B.A.) circuit. He later became a Pullman waiter or chef on the railways. Parker\\'s mother Addie worked nights at the local Western Union office.[8] His biggest influence at that time was a young trombone player named Robert Simpson, who taught him the basics of improvisation.[9]\\nIn the mid-1930s, Parker began to practice diligently. During this period he mastered improvisation and developed some of the ideas that led to the later development of Bebop. In an interview with Paul Desmond, Parker said that he spent three to four years practicing up to 15 hours a day.[10][11]\\nBands led by Count Basie and Bennie Moten certainly influenced Parker. He played with local bands in jazz clubs around Kansas City, Missouri, where he perfected his technique, with the assistance of Buster Smith, whose dynamic transitions to double and triple time influenced Parker\\'s developing style.\\nIn late spring 1936, Parker played at a jam session at the Reno Club in Kansas City. His attempt to improvise failed when he lost track of the chord changes. This prompted Jo Jones, the drummer for Count Basie\\'s Orchestra, to contemptuously take a cymbal off of his drum set and throw it at his feet as a signal to leave the stage.[12] However, rather than discouraging Parker, the incident caused him to vow to practice harder, and turned out to be a seminal moment in the young musician\\'s career when he returned as a new man a year later.[13] Parker proposed to his wife, Rebecca Ruffin, the same year and the two were married on July 25, 1936.[14] In the fall of 1936, Parker traveled with a band from Kansas City to the Ozarks for the opening of Clarence Musser\\'s Tavern south of Eldon, Missouri. Along the way, the caravan of musicians had a car accident and Parker broke three ribs and fractured his spine.[15] The accident led to Parker\\'s ultimate troubles with pain killers and opioids, especially heroin. Parker struggled with drug use for the rest of his life.\\nDespite his near-death experience on the way to the Ozarks in 1936, Parker returned to the area in 1937 where he spent some serious time woodshedding and developing his sound.[5][16] In 1938 Parker joined pianist Jay McShann\\'s territory band.[17] The band toured nightclubs and other venues of the southwest, as well as Chicago and New York City.[18][19] Parker made his professional recording debut with McShann\\'s band.\\nIn 1939 Parker moved to New York City, to pursue a career in music. He held several other jobs as well. He worked for nine dollars a week as a dishwasher at Jimmie\\'s Chicken Shack, where pianist Art Tatum performed.[20]  It was in 1939 in New York that Parker had his musical breakthrough that had begun in 1937 in the Missouri Ozarks. Playing through the changes on the song \"Cherokee\", Parker discovered a new musical vocabulary and sound that shifted the course of music history.[21]\\nIn 1940, he returned to Kansas City to perform with Jay McShann and to attend the funeral of his father, Charles Sr. He played Fairyland Park in the summer with McShann\\'s band at 75th and Prospect for all-white audiences. The up-side of the summer was his introduction to Dizzy Gillespie by Step Buddy Anderson near 19th and Vine in the summer of 1940.[5][16] After the summer season at Fairyland, Parker left with McShann\\'s band for gigs in the region. On a trip to Omaha he earned his nickname from McShann and the band after an incident with a chicken and the tour bus.\\nIn 1942 Parker left McShann\\'s band and played for one year with Earl Hines, whose band included Dizzy Gillespie, who later played with Parker as a duo. This period is virtually undocumented, due to the strike of 1942–1943 by the American Federation of Musicians, during which time few professional recordings were made.[22] Parker joined a group of young musicians, and played in after-hours clubs in Harlem, such as Clark Monroe\\'s Uptown House. These young iconoclasts included Gillespie, pianist Thelonious Monk, guitarist Charlie Christian, and drummer Kenny Clarke. According to Mary Lou Williams, the group was formed in order \"to challenge the practice of downtown musicians coming uptown and \\'stealing\\' the music.\"[23] She recalled: \"Monk and some of the cleverest of the young musicians used to complain: \\'We\\'ll never get credit for what we\\'re doing.\\' They had reason to say it... In the music business the going is tough for original talent. Everybody is being exploited through paid-for publicity and most anybody can become a great name if he can afford enough of it. In the end the public believes what it reads. So it is often difficult for the real talent to break through... Anyway, Monk said: \\'We\\'re going to get a big band started. We\\'re going to create something they can\\'t steal, because they can\\'t play it.\\'\"[24]\\nOne night in 1939, Parker was playing \"Cherokee\" in a practice session with guitarist William \"Biddy\" Fleet when he hit upon a method for developing his solos that enabled one of his main musical innovations. He realized that the 12 semitones of the chromatic scale can lead melodically to any key, breaking some of the confines of simpler jazz soloing. He recalled: \"I was jamming in a chili house on Seventh Avenue between 139th and 140th. It was December 1939. Now I\\'d been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used all the time at the time, and I kept thinking there\\'s bound to be something else. I could hear it sometimes but I couldn\\'t play it... Well, that night I was working over \\'Cherokee\\' and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I\\'d been hearing. I came alive.\"[21]\\nEarly in its development, this new type of jazz was rejected by many of the established, traditional jazz musicians who disdained their younger counterparts. The beboppers responded by calling these traditionalists \"moldy figs\". However, some musicians, such as Coleman Hawkins and Tatum, were more positive about its development, and participated in jam sessions and recording dates in the new approach with its adherents.\\nBecause of the two-year Musicians\\' Union ban of all commercial recordings from 1942 to 1944, much of bebop\\'s early development was not captured for posterity. As a result, it gained limited radio exposure. Bebop musicians had a difficult time gaining widespread recognition. It was not until 1945, when the recording ban was lifted, that Parker\\'s collaborations with Dizzy Gillespie, Max Roach, Bud Powell and others had a substantial effect on the jazz world. (One of their first small-group performances together was rediscovered and issued in 2005: a concert in New York\\'s Town Hall on June 22, 1945.) Bebop soon gained wider appeal among musicians and fans alike.\\nOn November 26, 1945, Parker led a record date for the Savoy label, marketed as the \"greatest Jazz session ever.\" Recording as Charlie Parker\\'s Reboppers, Parker enlisted such sidemen as Gillespie and Miles Davis on trumpet, Curley Russell on bass and Max Roach on drums. The tracks recorded during this session include \"Ko-Ko\", \"Billie\\'s Bounce\" and \"Now\\'s the Time\".\\nIn December 1945, the Parker band traveled to an unsuccessful engagement at Billy Berg\\'s club in Los Angeles. Most of the group returned to New York, but Parker remained in California, cashing in his return ticket to buy heroin. He experienced great hardship in California, eventually being committed to Camarillo State Mental Hospital for a six-month period.\\nWhen Parker received his discharge from the hospital, he was clean and healthy. Before leaving California, he recorded \"Relaxin\\' at Camarillo\" in reference to his stay in the mental hospital. However, when he returned to New York he resumed his heroin usage. During this time he still managed to record dozens of sides for the Savoy and Dial labels, which remain some of the high points of his recorded output. Many of these were with his so-called \"classic quintet\" including Davis and Roach.[25]\\nIn 1952, Parker and Gillespie released an album entitled Bird and Diz.[26]\\nA longstanding desire of Parker\\'s was to perform with a string section. He was a keen student of classical music, and contemporaries reported he was most interested in the music and formal innovations of Igor Stravinsky and longed to engage in a project akin to what later became known as Third Stream, a new kind of music, incorporating both jazz and classical elements as opposed to merely incorporating a string section into performance of jazz standards. On November 30, 1949, Norman Granz arranged for Parker to record an album of ballads with a mixed group of jazz and chamber orchestra musicians.[27] Six master takes from this session became the album Charlie Parker with Strings: \"Just Friends\", \"Everything Happens to Me\", \"April in Paris\", \"Summertime\", \"I Didn\\'t Know What Time It Was\", and \"If I Should Lose You\".\\nIn 1953, Parker performed at Massey Hall in Toronto, joined by Gillespie, Mingus, Powell and Roach.[28] Unfortunately, the concert happened at the same time as a televised heavyweight boxing match between Rocky Marciano and Jersey Joe Walcott, so the musical event was poorly attended.[29] Mingus recorded the concert, resulting in the album Jazz at Massey Hall.[29] At this concert, Parker played a plastic Grafton saxophone.[30]\\nParker died on March 12, 1955, in the suite of his friend and patron Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter at the Stanhope Hotel in New York City, while watching The Dorsey Brothers\\' Stage Show on television. The official causes of death were lobar pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer, but Parker also had an advanced case of cirrhosis and had suffered a heart attack. The coroner who performed his autopsy mistakenly estimated Parker\\'s 34-year-old body to be between 50 and 60 years of age.[31]\\nSince 1950, Parker had been living in New York City with his common-law wife, Chan Berg, the mother of his son Baird (who lived until 2014)[32] and his daughter Pree (who died at age 3).[33] He considered Chan his wife, although he never married her, nor did he divorce his previous wife, Doris, whom he had married in 1948. His marital status complicated the settling of Parker\\'s estate and would ultimately serve to frustrate his wish to be quietly interred in New York City.\\nDizzy Gillespie paid for the funeral arrangements[34] and organized a lying-in-state, a Harlem procession officiated by Congressman and Reverend Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., as well as a memorial concert. Parker\\'s body was flown back to Missouri, in accordance with his mother\\'s wishes. Berg criticized Doris and Parker\\'s family for giving him a Christian funeral, even though they knew he was a confirmed atheist.[35] Parker was buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Missouri, in a hamlet known as Blue Summit, located close to I-435 and East Truman Road.\\nParker\\'s estate is managed by Jampol Artist Management.[36]\\nSome amount of controversy continued after Parker\\'s burial in the Kansas City area.  His tomb was engraved with the image of a tenor saxophone, though Parker is primarily associated with the alto saxophone.  Later, some people wanted to move Parker\\'s remains to reinforce redevelopment of the historic 18th and Vine area [37]\\nParker\\'s life was riddled with mental health problems and an addiction to heroin.[38] Although unclear which came first, his addiction to opiates began at the age of 16, when he was injured in a car crash and a doctor prescribed morphine for the pain. The addiction that stemmed from this incident led him to miss performances, and to be considered unreliable.[38] In the jazz scene heroin use was prevalent, and the substance could be acquired with little difficulty.[39]\\nAlthough he produced many brilliant recordings during this period, Parker\\'s behavior became increasingly erratic. Heroin was difficult to obtain once he moved to California, where the drug was less abundant, so he used alcohol as a substitute. A recording for the Dial label from July 29, 1946, provides evidence of his condition. Before this session, Parker drank a quart of whiskey. According to the liner notes of Charlie Parker on Dial Volume 1, Parker missed most of the first two bars of his first chorus on the track, \"Max Making Wax.\" When he finally did come in, he swayed wildly and once spun all the way around, away from his microphone. On the next tune, \"Lover Man,\" producer Ross Russell physically  supported Parker. On \"Bebop\" (the final track Parker recorded that evening) he begins a solo with a solid first eight bars; on his second eight bars, however, he begins to struggle, and a desperate Howard McGhee, the trumpeter on this session, shouts, \"Blow!\" at him. Charles Mingus considered this version of \"Lover Man\" to be among Parker\\'s greatest recordings, despite its flaws.[40] Nevertheless, Parker hated the recording and never forgave Ross Russell for releasing it. He re-recorded the tune in 1951 for Verve.\\nParker\\'s life took a turn for the worse in March 1954 when his three-year-old daughter Pree died of illness.[33] He attempted suicide twice in 1954, which once again landed him in a mental hospital.[41]\\nParker\\'s style of composition involved interpolation of original melodies over existing jazz forms and standards, a practice known as contrafact and still common in jazz today. Examples include \"Ornithology\" (which borrows the chord progression of jazz standard \"How High the Moon\" and is said to be co-written with trumpet player Little Benny Harris), and \"Moose The Mooche\" (one of many Parker compositions based on the chord progression of \"I Got Rhythm\").  The practice was not uncommon prior to bebop, but it became a signature of the movement as artists began to move away from arranging popular standards and toward composing their own material.\\nWhile tunes such as \"Now\\'s The Time\", \"Billie\\'s Bounce\", \"Au Privave\", \"Barbados\", \"Relaxin\\' at Camarillo\", \"Bloomdido\", and \"Cool Blues\" were based on conventional 12-bar blues changes, Parker also created a unique version of the 12-bar blues for tunes such as \"Blues for Alice\", \"Laird Baird\", and \"Si Si.\" These unique chords are known popularly as \"Bird Changes\". Like his solos, some of his compositions are characterized by long, complex melodic lines and a minimum of repetition, although he did employ the use of repetition in some tunes, most notably \"Now\\'s The Time\".\\nParker contributed greatly to the modern jazz solo, one in which triplets and pick-up notes were used in unorthodox ways to lead into chord tones, affording the soloist more freedom to use passing tones, which soloists previously avoided. Parker was admired for his unique style of phrasing and innovative use of rhythm. Through his recordings and the popularity of the posthumously published Charlie Parker Omnibook, Parker\\'s identifiable style dominated jazz for many years to come.\\nOther well-known Parker compositions include \"Ah-Leu-Cha\", \"Anthropology\", co-written with Gillespie, \"Confirmation\", \"Constellation\", \"Moose the Mooche\", \"Scrapple from the Apple\" and \"Yardbird Suite\", the vocal version of which is called \"What Price Love\", with lyrics by Parker.\\nMiles Davis once said, \"You can tell the history of jazz in four words: Louis Armstrong. Charlie Parker\".[42]\\nGrammy Award\\nGrammy Hall of Fame\\nRecordings of Charlie Parker were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old, and that have \"qualitative or historical significance.\"\\nInductions\\nIn 1995, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32-cent commemorative postage stamp in Parker\\'s honor.[45]\\nIn 2002, the Library of Congress honored his recording \"Ko-Ko\" (1945) by adding it to the National Recording Registry.\\nFrom 1950 to 1954, Parker lived with Chan Berg on the ground floor of the townhouse at 151 Avenue B, across from Tompkins Square Park on Manhattan\\'s Lower East Side. The Gothic Revival building, which was built about 1849,[48] was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994[49] and was designated a New York City landmark in 1999. Avenue B between East 7th and East 10th Streets was given the honorary designation \"Charlie Parker Place\" in 1992.\\n', 'Dizzy_Gillespie': '\\nJohn Birks \"Dizzy\" Gillespie (/ɡɪˈlɛspi/; October 21, 1917 – January 6, 1993) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, composer, educator and singer.[2] He was a trumpet virtuoso and improviser, building on the virtuoso style of Roy Eldridge[3] but adding layers of harmonic and rhythmic complexity previously unheard in jazz. His combination of musicianship, showmanship, and wit made him a leading popularizer of the new music called bebop. His beret and horn-rimmed spectacles, scat singing, bent horn, pouched cheeks, and light-hearted personality provided some of bebop\\'s most prominent symbols.[2]\\nIn the 1940s Gillespie, with Charlie Parker, became a major figure in the development of bebop and modern jazz.[4] He taught and influenced many other musicians, including trumpeters Miles Davis, Jon Faddis, Fats Navarro, Clifford Brown, Arturo Sandoval, Lee Morgan,[5] Chuck Mangione,[6] and balladeer Johnny Hartman.[7]\\nScott Yanow wrote, \"Dizzy Gillespie\\'s contributions to jazz were huge. One of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all time, Gillespie was such a complex player that his contemporaries ended up being similar to those of Miles Davis and Fats Navarro instead, and it was not until Jon Faddis\\'s emergence in the 1970s that Dizzy\\'s style was successfully recreated [....] Gillespie is remembered, by both critics and fans alike, as one of the greatest jazz trumpeters of all time\".[8]\\nThe youngest of nine children of Lottie and James Gillespie, Dizzy Gillespie was born in Cheraw, South Carolina.[9] His father was a local bandleader,[10] so instruments were made available to the children. Gillespie started to play the piano at the age of four.[11] Gillespie\\'s father died when he was only ten years old. He taught himself how to play the trombone as well as the trumpet by the age of twelve. From the night he heard his idol, Roy Eldridge, on the radio, he dreamed of becoming a jazz musician.[12]\\nHe won a music scholarship to the Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina which he attended for two years before accompanying his family when they moved to Philadelphia in 1935.[13][14]\\nGillespie\\'s first professional job was with the Frank Fairfax Orchestra in 1935, after which he joined the respective orchestras of Edgar Hayes and later Teddy Hill, replacing Frankie Newton as second trumpet in May 1937. Teddy Hill\\'s band was where Gillespie made his first recording, \"King Porter Stomp\". In August 1937 while gigging with Hayes in Washington D.C., Gillespie met a young dancer named Lorraine Willis who worked a Baltimore–Philadelphia–New York City circuit which included the Apollo Theater. Willis was not immediately friendly but Gillespie was attracted anyway. The two married on May 9, 1940.[15]\\nGillespie stayed with Teddy Hill\\'s band for a year, then left and freelanced with other bands.[5] In 1939, with the help of Willis, Gillespie joined Cab Calloway\\'s orchestra.[13] He recorded one of his earliest compositions, \"Pickin\\' the Cabbage\", with Calloway in 1940. After an altercation between the two, Calloway fired Gillespie in late 1941. The incident is recounted by Gillespie and Calloway\\'s band members Milt Hinton and Jonah Jones in Jean Bach\\'s 1997 film, The Spitball Story. Calloway disapproved of Gillespie\\'s mischievous humor and his adventuresome approach to soloing. According to Jones, Calloway referred to it as \"Chinese music\". During rehearsal, someone in the band threw a spitball. Already in a foul mood, Calloway blamed Gillespie, who refused to take the blame. Gillespie stabbed Calloway in the leg with a knife. Calloway had minor cuts on the thigh and wrist. After the two were separated, Calloway fired Gillespie. A few days later, Gillespie tried to apologize to Calloway, but he was dismissed.[16]\\nDuring his time in Calloway\\'s band, Gillespie started writing big band music for Woody Herman and Jimmy Dorsey.[5] He then freelanced with a few bands, most notably Ella Fitzgerald\\'s orchestra, composed of members of the Chick Webb\\'s band.\\nGillespie did not serve in World War II. At his Selective Service interview, he told the local board, \"in this stage of my life here in the United States whose foot has been in my ass?\" and \"So if you put me out there with a gun in my hand and tell me to shoot at the enemy, I\\'m liable to create a case of \\'mistaken identity\\' of who I might shoot.\" He was classified 4-F.[17][18] In 1943, he joined the Earl Hines band. Composer Gunther Schuller said,\\n ... In 1943 I heard the great Earl Hines band which had Bird in it and all those other great musicians. They were playing all the flatted fifth chords and all the modern harmonies and substitutions and Gillespie runs in the trumpet section work. Two years later I read that that was \\'bop\\' and the beginning of modern jazz ... but the band never made recordings.[19]Gillespie said of the Hines band, \"[p]eople talk about the Hines band being \\'the incubator of bop\\' and the leading exponents of that music ended up in the Hines band. But people also have the erroneous impression that the music was new. It was not. The music evolved from what went before. It was the same basic music. The difference was in how you got from here to here to here ... naturally each age has got its own shit.\"[20]\\nGillespie joined the big band of Hines\\' long-time collaborator Billy Eckstine, and it was as a member of Eckstine\\'s band that he was reunited with Charlie Parker, a fellow member. In 1945, Gillespie left Eckstine\\'s band because he wanted to play with a small combo. A \"small combo\" typically comprised no more than five musicians, playing the trumpet, saxophone, piano, bass and drums.\\nBebop was known as the first modern jazz style. However, it was unpopular in the beginning and was not viewed as positively as swing music was. Bebop was seen as an outgrowth of swing, not a revolution. Swing introduced a diversity of new musicians in the bebop era like Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Kenny Clarke, Oscar Pettiford, and Gillespie. Through these musicians, a new vocabulary of musical phrases was created. With Parker, Gillespie jammed at famous jazz clubs like Minton\\'s Playhouse and Monroe\\'s Uptown House. Parker\\'s system also held methods of adding chords to existing chord progressions and implying additional chords within the improvised lines\\nGillespie compositions like \"Groovin\\' High\", \"Woody \\'n\\' You\", and \"Salt Peanuts\" sounded radically different, harmonically and rhythmically, from the swing music popular at the time. \"A Night in Tunisia\", written in 1942, while he was playing with Earl Hines\\' band, is noted for having a feature that is common in today\\'s music: a syncopated bass line.[21] \"Woody \\'n\\' You\" was recorded in a session led by Coleman Hawkins with Gillespie as a featured sideman on February 16, 1944 (Apollo), the first formal recording of bebop. He appeared in recordings by the Billy Eckstine band and started recording prolifically as a leader and sideman in early 1945. He was not content to let bebop sit in a niche of small groups in small clubs. A concert by one of his small groups in New York\\'s Town Hall on June 22, 1945 presented bebop to a broad audience; recordings of it were released in 2005. He started to organize big bands in late 1945. Dizzy Gillespie and his Bebop Six, which included Parker, started an extended gig at Billy Berg\\'s club in Los Angeles in December 1945. Reception was mixed and the band broke up. In February 1946 he signed a contract with Bluebird, gaining the distribution power of RCA for his music. He and his big band headlined the 1946 film Jivin\\' in Be-Bop.[22]\\nAfter his work with Parker, Gillespie led other small combos (including ones with Milt Jackson, John Coltrane, Lalo Schifrin, Ray Brown, Kenny Clarke, James Moody, J.J. Johnson, and Yusef Lateef) and put together his successful big bands starting in 1947. He and his big bands, with arrangements provided by Tadd Dameron, Gil Fuller, and George Russell, popularized bebop and made him a symbol of the new music.[23]\\nHis big bands of the late 1940s also featured Cuban rumberos Chano Pozo and Sabu Martinez, sparking interest in Afro-Cuban jazz. He appeared frequently as a soloist with Norman Granz\\'s Jazz at the Philharmonic.\\nGillespie and his Bee Bop Orchestra was the featured star of the 4th Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on September 12, 1948.[24] The young maestro had recently returned from Europe where his music rocked the continent.  The program description noted \"the musicianship, inventive technique, and daring of this young man has created a new style, which can be defined as off the chord solo gymnastics.\"  Also on the program that day were Frankie Laine, Little Miss Cornshucks, The Sweethearts of Rhythm, The Honeydrippers, Big Joe Turner, Jimmy Witherspoon, The Blenders, and The Sensations.[25]\\nIn 1948, Gillespie was involved in a traffic accident when the bicycle he was riding was bumped by an automobile. He was slightly injured and found that he could no longer hit the B-flat above high C. He won the case, but the jury awarded him only $1000 in view of his high earnings up to that point.[26]\\nIn 1951, Gillespie founded his record label, Dee Gee Records; it closed in 1953.[27]\\nOn January 6, 1953, he threw a party for his wife Lorraine at Snookie\\'s, a club in Manhattan, where his trumpet\\'s bell got bent upward in an accident, but he liked the sound so much he had a special trumpet made with a 45 degree raised bell, becoming his trademark.\\nIn 1956 Gillespie organized a band to go on a State Department tour of the Middle East which was well-received internationally and earned him the nickname \"the Ambassador of Jazz\".[28][29] During this time, he also continued to lead a big band that performed throughout the United States and featured musicians including Pee Wee Moore and others. This band recorded a live album at the 1957 Newport jazz festival that featured Mary Lou Williams as a guest artist on piano.[30]\\nIn the late 1940s, Gillespie was involved in the movement called Afro-Cuban music, bringing Afro-Latin American music and elements to greater prominence in jazz and even pop music, particularly salsa. Afro-Cuban jazz is based on traditional Afro-Cuban rhythms. Gillespie was introduced to Chano Pozo in 1947 by Mario Bauza, a Latin jazz trumpet player. Chano Pozo became Gillespie\\'s conga drummer for his band. Gillespie also worked with Mario Bauza in New York jazz clubs on 52nd Street and several famous dance clubs such as the Palladium and the Apollo Theater in Harlem. They played together in the Chick Webb band and Cab Calloway\\'s band, where Gillespie and Bauza became lifelong friends. Gillespie helped develop and mature the Afro-Cuban jazz style. Afro-Cuban jazz was considered bebop-oriented, and some musicians classified it as a modern style. Afro-Cuban jazz was successful because it never decreased in popularity and it always attracted people to dance.[31]\\nGillespie\\'s most famous contributions to Afro-Cuban music are \"Manteca\" and \"Tin Tin Deo\" (both co-written with Chano Pozo); he was responsible for commissioning George Russell\\'s \"Cubano Be, Cubano Bop\", which featured Pozo. In 1977, Gillespie met Arturo Sandoval during a jazz cruise to Havana.[32]  Sandoval toured with Gillespie and defected in Rome in 1990 while touring with Gillespie and the United Nations Orchestra.[33]\\nIn the 1980s, Gillespie led the United Nation Orchestra. For three years Flora Purim toured with the Orchestra. She credits Gillespie with improving her understanding of jazz.[34]\\nIn 1982, he was sought out by Motown musician Stevie Wonder to play his solo in Wonder\\'s 1982 hit single, \"Do I Do\".\\nHe starred in the film The Winter in Lisbon that was released as El invierno en Lisboa in 1992 and re-released in 2004.[35] The soundtrack album, featuring him, was recorded in 1990 and released in 1991. The film is a crime drama about a jazz pianist who falls for a dangerous woman while in Portugal with an American expatriate\\'s jazz band.\\nIn December 1991, during an engagement at Kimball\\'s East in Emeryville, California, he suffered a crisis from what turned out to be pancreatic cancer. He performed one more night but cancelled the rest of the tour for medical reasons, ending his 56-year touring career. He led his last recording session on January 25, 1992.[36]\\nOn November 26, 1992, Carnegie Hall, following the Second Baháʼí World Congress, celebrated Gillespie\\'s 75th birthday concert and his offering to the celebration of the centenary of the passing of Baháʼu\\'lláh. Gillespie was to appear at Carnegie Hall for the 33rd time. The line-up included Jon Faddis, James Moody, Paquito D\\'Rivera, and the Mike Longo Trio with Ben Brown on bass and Mickey Roker on drums. Gillespie was too unwell to attend. \"But the musicians played their real hearts out for him, no doubt suspecting that he would not play again. Each musician gave tribute to their friend, this great soul and innovator in the world of jazz.\"[37]\\nA longtime resident of Englewood, New Jersey,[38] Gillespie died of pancreatic cancer on January 6, 1993, at the age of 75 and was buried in Flushing Cemetery, Queens, New York City. Mike Longo delivered a eulogy at his funeral.\\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Dizzy Gillespie among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[39]\\nIn 1962, Gillespie and actor George Mathews starred in The Hole, an animated short film by John and Faith Hubley. Released the same year as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it uses audio from an improvised conversation between the two debating the causes of accidents and the possibility of accidentally launching nuclear weapons. The short went on to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film the following year.[40]\\nDuring the 1964 United States presidential campaign, Gillespie put himself forward as an independent write-in candidate.[41][42] He promised that if he were elected, the White House would be renamed the Blues House, and he would have a cabinet composed of Duke Ellington (Secretary of State), Miles Davis (Director of the CIA), Max Roach (Secretary of Defense), Charles Mingus (Secretary of Peace), Ray Charles (Librarian of Congress), Louis Armstrong (Secretary of Agriculture), Mary Lou Williams (Ambassador to the Vatican), Thelonious Monk (Travelling Ambassador) and Malcolm X (Attorney General).[43][44] He said his running mate would be Phyllis Diller. Campaign buttons had been manufactured years before by Gillespie\\'s booking agency as a joke[45] but proceeds went to Congress of Racial Equality, Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Martin Luther King Jr.;[46] in later years they became a collector\\'s item.[47] In 1971, he announced he would run again[48][49] but withdrew before the election.[50]\\nShortly after the death of Charlie Parker, Gillespie encountered an audience member after a show. They had a conversation about the oneness of humanity and the elimination of racism from the perspective of the Baháʼí Faith. Impacted by the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, he became a Baháʼí that same year.[51][52] The universalist emphasis of his religion prodded him to see himself more as a global citizen and humanitarian, expanding on his interest in his African heritage. His spirituality brought out generosity and what author Nat Hentoff called an inner strength, discipline, and \"soul force\".[53]\\nGillespie\\'s conversion was most affected by Bill Sears\\' book Thief in the Night.[51] Gillespie spoke about the Baháʼí Faith frequently on his trips abroad.[54][55][56] He is honored with weekly jazz sessions at the New York Baháʼí Center in the memorial auditorium.[57]\\nGillespie married dancer Lorraine Willis in Boston on May 9, 1940.[13] They remained together until his death in 1993.[15] Willis managed his business and personal affairs.[58] The couple had no children, but Gillespie fathered a daughter, jazz singer Jeanie Bryson, born in 1958 from an affair with songwriter Connie Bryson.[59][60] Gillespie met Bryson, a Juilliard-trained pianist, at the jazz club Birdland in New York City.[60] Although the paternity of his daughter was kept a secret from the public, Gillespie sporadically communicated with her through the years. Through Bryson, Gillespie was a grandfather to Radji Birks Bryson-Barrett.[61]\\nGillespie has been described as the \"sound of surprise\".[53] The Rough Guide to Jazz describes his musical style:\\nThe whole essence of a Gillespie solo was cliff-hanging suspense: the phrases and the angle of the approach were perpetually varied, breakneck runs were followed by pauses, by huge interval leaps, by long, immensely high notes, by slurs and smears and bluesy phrases; he always took listeners by surprise, always shocking them with a new thought. His lightning reflexes and superb ear meant his instrumental execution matched his thoughts in its power and speed. And he was concerned at all times with swing—even taking the most daring liberties with pulse or beat, his phrases never failed to swing. Gillespie\\'s magnificent sense of time and emotional intensity of his playing came from childhood roots. His parents were Methodists, but as a boy he used to sneak off every Sunday to the uninhibited Sanctified Church. He said later, \"The Sanctified Church had deep significance for me musically. I first learned the significance of rhythm there and all about how music can transport people spiritually.\"[62]In Gillespie\\'s obituary, Peter Watrous describes his performance style:\\nIn the naturally effervescent Mr. Gillespie, opposites existed. His playing—and he performed constantly until nearly the end of his life—was meteoric, full of virtuosic invention and deadly serious. But with his endlessly funny asides, his huge variety of facial expressions and his natural comic gifts, he was as much a pure entertainer as an accomplished artist.[2]Wynton Marsalis summarized Gillespie as a player and teacher:\\nHis playing showcases the importance of intelligence. His rhythmic sophistication was unequaled. He was a master of harmony—and fascinated with studying it. He took in all the music of his youth—from Roy Eldridge to Duke Ellington—and developed a unique style built on complex rhythm and harmony balanced by wit. Gillespie was so quick-minded, he could create an endless flow of ideas at unusually fast tempo. Nobody had ever even considered playing a trumpet that way, let alone had actually tried. All the musicians respected him because, in addition to outplaying everyone, he knew so much and was so generous with that knowledge...[63]Gillespie\\'s trademark trumpet featured a bell which bent upward at a 45-degree angle rather than pointing straight ahead as in the conventional design. According to Gillespie\\'s autobiography, this was originally the result of accidental damage caused by the dancers Stump and Stumpy falling onto the instrument while it was on a trumpet stand on stage at Snookie\\'s in Manhattan on January 6, 1953, during a birthday party for Gillespie\\'s wife Lorraine.[64] The constriction caused by the bending altered the tone of the instrument, and Gillespie liked the effect. He had the trumpet straightened out the next day, but he could not forget the tone. Gillespie sent a request to Martin to make him a \"bent\" trumpet from a sketch produced by Lorraine, and from that time forward played a trumpet with an upturned bell.[65]\\nBy June 1954 he was using a professionally manufactured horn of this design, and it was to become a trademark for the rest of his life.[53]:258–259 Such trumpets were made for him by Martin (from 1954), King Musical Instruments (from 1972) and Renold Schilke (from 1982, a gift from Jon Faddis).[65] Gillespie favored mouthpieces made by Al Cass. In December 1986 Gillespie gave the National Museum of American History his 1972 King \"Silver Flair\" trumpet with a Cass mouthpiece.[65][66]\\nIn April 1995, Gillespie\\'s Martin trumpet was auctioned at Christie\\'s in New York City with instruments used by Coleman Hawkins, Jimi Hendrix, and Elvis Presley.[67] An image of Gillespie\\'s trumpet was selected for the cover of the auction program. The battered instrument was sold to Manhattan builder Jeffery Brown for $63,000, the proceeds benefiting jazz musicians with cancer.[68][69][70]\\nIn 1989, Gillespie was given the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. The next year, at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ceremonies celebrating the centennial of American jazz, Gillespie received the Kennedy Center Honors Award and the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Duke Ellington Award for 50 years of achievement as a composer, performer, and bandleader.[71][72]\\nIn 1989, Gillespie was awarded with an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee College of Music.[73]\\nIn 1991, Gillespie received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Wynton Marsalis.[74]\\nIn 1993 he received the Polar Music Prize in Sweden.[75] In 2002, he was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame for his contributions to Afro-Cuban music.[76] He was honored on December 31, 2006 in A Jazz New Year\\'s Eve: Freddy Cole & the Dizzy Gillespie All-Star Big Band at The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.[77] In 2014, Gillespie was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.[78]\\nSamuel E. Wright played Dizzy Gillespie in the film Bird (1988), about Charlie Parker.[79] Kevin Hanchard portrayed Gillespie in the Chet Baker biopic Born to Be Blue (2015).[80] Charles S. Dutton played him in For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story (2000).\\n', 'Art_Tatum': '\\n\\nArthur Tatum Jr. (/ˈteɪtəm/, October 13, 1909 – November 5, 1956) was an American jazz pianist who is widely regarded as one of the greatest in his field.[1][2] From early in his career, Tatum\\'s technical ability was regarded by fellow musicians as extraordinary. Many pianists attempted to copy him; others questioned their own skills after encountering him, and some even switched instruments in response. In addition to being acclaimed for his virtuoso technique, Tatum extended the vocabulary and boundaries of jazz piano far beyond his initial stride influences, and established new ground in jazz through innovative use of reharmonization, voicing, and bitonality.\\nTatum grew up in Toledo, Ohio, where he began playing piano professionally and had his own radio program, rebroadcast nationwide, while still in his teens. He left Toledo in 1932 and had residencies as a solo pianist at clubs in major urban centers including New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. In that decade, he settled into a pattern that he followed for most of his career – paid performances followed by long after-hours playing, all accompanied by prodigious consumption of alcohol. He was said to be more spontaneous and creative in these after-hours venues, and although the drinking did not negatively affect his playing, it did damage his health.\\nIn the 1940s, Tatum led a commercially successful trio for a short time and began playing in more formal jazz concert settings, including at Norman Granz-produced Jazz at the Philharmonic events. His popularity diminished towards the end of the decade, as he continued to play in his own style, ignoring the rise of bebop. Granz recorded Tatum extensively in solo and small group formats in the mid-1950s, with the last session occurring only two months before the pianist\\'s death from uremia at the age of 47.\\nTatum\\'s mother, Mildred Hoskins, was born in Martinsville, Virginia,[3] around 1890, and was a domestic worker.[4] His father, Arthur Tatum Sr., was born in Statesville, North Carolina,[3][note 1] and had steady employment as a mechanic.[6] In 1909, they made their way from North Carolina to begin a new life in Toledo, Ohio.[7] The couple had four children; Art was the oldest to survive, and was born in Toledo on October 13, 1909.[8] He was followed by Arline nine years later and by Karl after another two years.[9] Karl went to college and became a social worker.[4] The Tatum family was regarded as conventional and church-going.[10]\\nFrom infancy, Tatum had impaired vision.[11] Several explanations for this have been posited, most involving cataracts.[11][note 2] As a result of eye operations, by the age of 11 Tatum could see objects close to him and perhaps distinguish colors.[12] Any benefits from these procedures were reversed, however, when he was assaulted, probably in his early twenties.[13] The attack left him completely blind in his left eye and with very limited vision in his right.[14] Despite this, there are multiple accounts of him enjoying playing cards and pool.[15]\\nAccounts vary on whether Tatum\\'s parents played any musical instruments, but it is likely that he was exposed at an early age to church music, including through the Grace Presbyterian Church that his parents attended.[16] He also began playing the piano from a young age, playing by ear and aided by an excellent memory and sense of pitch.[17] Other musicians reported that he had perfect pitch.[18][19] As a child he was sensitive to the piano\\'s intonation and insisted it be tuned often.[20] He learned tunes from the radio, records, and by copying piano roll recordings.[21] In an interview as an adult, Tatum denied the story that his playing ability developed because he had attempted to reproduce piano roll recordings that, without his knowing, had been made by two performers.[22] His interest in sports was lifelong, and he displayed an encyclopedic memory for baseball statistics.[23]\\nTatum first attended Jefferson School in Toledo, then moved to the School for the Blind in Columbus, Ohio, late in 1924.[24] After probably less than a year there, he transferred to the Toledo School of Music.[25] Overton G. Rainey, who gave him formal piano lessons in the classical tradition at either the Jefferson School or the Toledo School of Music, was also visually impaired, did not improvise, and discouraged his students from playing jazz.[26] Based on this history, it is reasonable to assume that Tatum was largely self-taught as a pianist.[27] By the time he was a teenager, Tatum was asked to play at various social events, and he was probably being paid to play in Toledo clubs from around 1924–25.[28]\\nGrowing up, Tatum drew inspiration principally from Fats Waller and James P. Johnson, who exemplified the stride piano style, and to some extent from the more modern Earl Hines,[27][29] six years Tatum\\'s senior. Tatum identified Waller as his biggest influence, while pianist Teddy Wilson and saxophonist Eddie Barefield suggested that Hines was one of his favorite jazz pianists.[30] Another influence was pianist Lee Sims, who did not play jazz, but did use chord voicings and an orchestral approach (i.e. encompassing a full sound instead of highlighting one or more timbres[31]) that appeared in Tatum\\'s playing.[32]\\nIn 1927, after winning an amateur competition, Tatum began playing on Toledo radio station WSPD during interludes in a morning shopping program and soon had his own daily program.[33] After regular club dates, Tatum often visited after-hours clubs to be with other musicians; he enjoyed listening to other pianists and preferred to play after all the others had finished.[34] He frequently played for hours on end into the dawn; his radio show was scheduled for noon, allowing him time to rest before evening performances.[35] During 1928–29, the radio program was re-broadcast nationwide by the Blue Network.[33] Tatum also began to play in larger Midwestern cities outside his home town, including Cleveland, Columbus, and Detroit.[36]\\nAs word of Tatum spread, national performers passing through Toledo, including Duke Ellington and Fletcher Henderson, visited clubs where he was playing.[37] They were impressed by what they heard: from near the start of the pianist\\'s career, \"his accomplishment [...] was of a different order from what most people, from what even musicians, had ever heard. It made musicians reconsider their definitions of excellence, of what was possible\", his biographer reported.[38] Although Tatum was encouraged by comments from these and other established musicians, he felt that he was not yet, in the late 1920s, musically ready to relocate to New York City, which was the center of the jazz world and was home to many of the pianists he had listened to while growing up.[39]\\nThis had changed by the time that vocalist Adelaide Hall, touring the United States with two pianists, heard Tatum play in Toledo in 1932 and recruited him:[40] he took the opportunity to go to New York as part of her band.[41] On August 5 that year, Hall and her band recorded two sides (\"I\\'ll Never Be the Same\" and \"Strange as It Seems\") that were Tatum\\'s first studio recordings.[42] Two more sides with Hall followed five days later, as did a solo piano test-pressing of \"Tea for Two\" that was not released for several decades.[43]\\nAfter his arrival in New York, Tatum participated in a cutting contest at Morgan\\'s bar in Harlem, with the established stride piano masters – Johnson, Waller, and Willie \"The Lion\" Smith.[44] Standard contest pieces included Johnson\\'s \"Harlem Strut\" and \"Carolina Shout\" and Waller\\'s \"Handful of Keys\".[45] Tatum played his arrangements of \"Tea for Two\" and \"Tiger Rag\".[46] Reminiscing about Tatum\\'s debut, Johnson said, \"When Tatum played \\'Tea for Two\\' that night I guess that was the first time I ever heard it really played.\"[47] Tatum thus became the pre-eminent piano player in jazz.[48] He and Waller became good friends, with similar lifestyles – both drank prodigiously and lived as lavishly as their incomes permitted.[49]\\nTatum\\'s first solo piano job in New York was at the Onyx Club,[50] which was later reported to have paid him \"$45 a week and free whiskey\".[51] The Onyx was one of the first jazz clubs to open on 52nd Street,[50] which became the city\\'s focal point for public jazz performance for more than a decade.[52] He recorded his first four released solo sides, for Brunswick Records, in March 1933: \"St. Louis Blues\", \"Sophisticated Lady\", \"Tea for Two\", and \"Tiger Rag\".[53] The last of these was a minor hit, impressing the public with its startling tempo of approximately 376 (quarter note) beats per minute, and with right-hand eighth notes adding to the technical feat.[54]\\nTatum\\'s only known child, Orlando, was born in 1933, when Tatum was twenty-four.[55] The mother was Marnette Jackson, a waitress in Toledo; the pair were not married.[56] It is likely that neither parent had a major role in raising their son, who pursued a military career and died in the 1980s.[57]\\nDuring the hard economic times of 1934 and 1935, Tatum mostly played in clubs in Cleveland, but also recorded in New York four times in 1934 and once in the following year.[58] He also performed on national radio, including for the Fleischman Hour broadcast hosted by Rudy Vallee in 1935.[58] In August of the same year, he married Ruby Arnold, who was from Cleveland.[59] The following month, he began a residence of about a year at the Three Deuces in Chicago, initially as a soloist and then in a quartet of alto saxophone, guitar, and drums.[60]\\nAt the end of his first Three Deuces stint, Tatum moved to California, travelling by train because of his fear of flying.[61] There, he adopted the same pattern that he had followed from early in his career: paid performances followed by long after-hours sessions, all accompanied by prodigious drinking.[62] A friend from his early days in California observed that Tatum drank Pabst Blue Ribbon beer by the case.[63] This lifestyle contributed to the effects of the diabetes that Tatum probably developed as an adult, but, as highlighted by his biographer, James Lester, the pianist would have faced a conflict if he wanted to address the diabetes problem: \"concessions – drastically less beer, a controlled diet, more rest – would have taken away exactly the things that mattered most to him, and would have removed him from the night-life that he seemed to love more than almost anything (afternoon baseball or football games would probably come next)\".[64]\\nIn California, Tatum also played for Hollywood parties and appeared on Bing Crosby\\'s radio program late in 1936.[65] He recorded in Los Angeles for the first time early the following year – four tracks as the sextet named Art Tatum and His Swingsters,[66] for Decca Records.[67] Continuing to travel by long-distance train, Tatum settled into a pattern of performances at major jazz clubs in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, interspersed with appearances at minor clubs where musicians of his standing did not normally play.[68] Thus, in 1937 he left Los Angeles for another residence at the Three Deuces in Chicago, and then went on to the Famous Door club in New York,[68] where he opened for Louis Prima.[69] Tatum recorded for Brunswick again near the end of that year.[70]\\nIn March 1938, Tatum and his wife embarked on the Queen Mary for England.[71] He performed there for three months, and enjoyed the quiet listeners who, unlike some American audiences, did not talk over his playing.[71] While in England, he appeared twice on the BBC Television program Starlight.[72][73][74] Four of his very limited number of compositions were also published in Britain.[75] He then returned to the Three Deuces.[75] The overseas trip appeared to have boosted his reputation, particularly with the white public, and he was able to have club residencies of at least several weeks at a time in New York over the following few years, sometimes with stipulations that no food or drink would be served while he was playing.[76]\\nTatum recorded 16 sides in August 1938, but they were not released for at least a decade.[77] A similar thing happened the following year: of the 18 sides he recorded, only two were issued as 78s.[78] A possible explanation is that the increasing popularity of big band music and vocalists limited the demand for solo recordings.[79] One of the releases, a version of \"Tea for Two\", was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1986.[80] One recording from early in 1941, however, was commercially successful, with sales of perhaps 500,000.[79] This was \"Wee Baby Blues\", performed by a sextet and with the addition of Big Joe Turner on vocals.[79] Informal performances of Tatum\\'s playing in 1940 and 1941 were released decades later on the album God Is in the House,[81] for which he was posthumously awarded the 1973 Grammy for Best Jazz Performance by a Soloist.[82] The album title came from Waller\\'s reaction when he saw Tatum enter the club where Waller was performing: \"I only play the piano, but tonight God is in the house.\"[83]\\nTatum was, though, able to make a more than adequate living from his club performances.[79] Billboard magazine suggested that he could make at least $300 a week as a soloist in 1943;[84] when he formed a trio later that year, it was advertised by booking agents at $750 a week.[85] The other musicians in the trio were guitarist Tiny Grimes and bassist Slam Stewart.[86] They were a commercial success on 52nd Street, attracting more customers than any other musician, with the possible exception of vocalist Billie Holiday, and they also appeared briefly on film, in an episode of The March of Time.[87] As a solo pianist up to that point, Tatum was praised by critics, but the paying public had given him relatively little attention; with the trio, he enjoyed more popular success, although some critics expressed disappointment.[88] Nevertheless, Tatum was awarded Esquire magazine\\'s prize for pianists in its 1944 critics\\' poll, which led to his playing alongside other winners at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York.[89]\\nAll of Tatum\\'s studio recordings in 1944 were with the trio, and radio appearances continued.[90] He abandoned the trio in 1944,[91] possibly at an agent\\'s behest, and did not record with one again for eight years.[92] Early in 1945, Billboard reported that Tatum was being paid $1,150 a week as a soloist by the Downbeat Club on 52nd Street to play four sets of twenty minutes each per night.[93][94] This was described much later as an \"unheard-of figure\" for the time.[95] The Billboard reviewer commented that \"Tatum is given a broken-down instrument, some bad lights and nothing else\", and observed that he was almost inaudible beyond the front seating because of the audience noise.[94]\\nAided by name recognition from his record sales and reduced entertainer availability because of the World War II draft, Tatum began to play in more formal jazz concert settings from 1944[96] – appearing at concert halls in towns and universities all around the United States.[97] The venues were much larger than jazz clubs – some had capacities in excess of 3,000 people[98] – allowing Tatum to earn more money for much less work.[97] Despite the more formal concert settings, Tatum preferred not to adhere to a set program of pieces for these performances.[99] He recorded with the Barney Bigard Sextet and cut nine solo tracks in 1945.[92]\\nA fellow pianist from the years after World War II estimated that Tatum routinely drank two quarts (1.9 l) of whiskey and a case of beer over the course of 24 hours,[100] but almost all reports are that such drinking did not negatively affect his playing.[101] Rather than being deliberately or uncontrollably self-destructive, this habit was probably a product of his being careless about his health, which was a common characteristic of jazz musicians, and his enthusiasm for life.[102]\\nPerformances at concert settings continued in the second half of the 1940s, including participation in Norman Granz-produced Jazz at the Philharmonic events.[103] In 1947, Tatum again appeared on film, this time in The Fabulous Dorseys.[104] A 1949 concert at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles was recorded and released by Columbia Records as Gene Norman Presents an Art Tatum Concert.[105] In the same year, he signed to Capitol Records and recorded 26 pieces for them.[106] He also played for the first time at Club Alamo in Detroit, but stopped when a black friend was not served.[107] The owner subsequently advertised that black customers were welcome, and Tatum went on to play there frequently in the following few years.[107]\\nAlthough Tatum remained an admired figure, his popularity waned in the mid- to late 1940s.[108] This was because of the advent of bebop[108] – a musical style that Tatum did not embrace.[109]\\nTatum began working with a trio again in 1951.[110] The trio – this time with bassist Stewart and guitarist Everett Barksdale – recorded in 1952.[111] In the same year, Tatum toured the United States with fellow pianists Erroll Garner, Pete Johnson, and Meade Lux Lewis, for concerts billed as \"Piano Parade\".[112]\\nTatum\\'s four-year absence from the recording studios as a soloist ended when Granz, who owned Clef Records, decided to record his solo playing in a way that was \"unprecedented in the recording industry: invite him into the studio, start the tape, and let him play whatever he felt like playing. [...] At the time this was an astonishing enterprise, the most extensive recording that had been done of any jazz figure.\"[113] Over several sessions starting late in 1953, Tatum recorded 124 solo tracks, all but three of which were released, spread over a total of 14 LPs.[114] Granz reported that the recording tape ran out during one piece, but Tatum, instead of starting again from the beginning, asked to listen to a playback of just the final eight bars, then continued the performance from there on the new tape, keeping to the same tempo as on the first attempt.[115] The solo pieces were released by Clef as The Genius of Art Tatum,[115] and were added to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1978.[80]\\nGranz also recorded Tatum with a selection of other stars in 7 more recording sessions, which led to 59 tracks being released.[114] The critical reception was mixed and partly contradictory.[116] Tatum was, variously, criticized for not playing real jazz, the choice of material, and being past his best, and praised for the enthralling intricacy and detail of his playing, and his technical perfection.[117] Nevertheless, the releases renewed attention on the pianist, including for a newer generation; he won DownBeat magazine\\'s critics\\' poll for pianists three years in a row from 1954 (he never won a DownBeat readers\\' poll).[118]\\nFollowing a deterioration in his health, Tatum stopped drinking in 1954 and tried to control his weight.[119] That year, his trio was part of bandleader Stan Kenton\\'s 10-week tour named \"Festival of Modern American Jazz\".[120][121] The trio did not play with Kenton\\'s orchestra on the tour,[121] but they had the same performance schedule, meaning Tatum sometimes travelled long distances by overnight train while the others stayed in a hotel and then took a morning flight.[122] He also appeared on television in The Spike Jones Show on April 17, to promote the then imminent release of The Genius of Art Tatum.[123][124] Black American musicians were not often filmed at this time, so very few visual recordings of Tatum exist,[125] but his solo performance of \"Yesterdays\" on the show has survived as a video recording.[123]\\nTatum and Ruby divorced early in 1955.[126] They probably did not travel much together and she had become an alcoholic; the divorce was acrimonious.[127] He married again later that year – Geraldine Williamson, with whom he had probably already been living.[126] She had little interest in music, and did not normally attend his performances.[128]\\nBy 1956, Tatum\\'s health had deteriorated due to advanced uremia.[129] Nevertheless, in August of that year he played to the largest audience of his career: 19,000 gathered at the Hollywood Bowl for another Granz-led event.[129] The following month, he had the last of the Granz group recording sessions, with saxophonist Ben Webster, and then played at least two concerts in October.[130] He was too unwell to continue touring, so returned to his home in Los Angeles.[131] Musicians visited him on November 4, and other pianists played for him as he lay in bed.[132]\\nTatum died the following day, at Queen of Angels Medical Center in Los Angeles, from uremia.[133] He was buried at Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles,[134] but was moved to the Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California, in 1992[135] by his second wife, so she could be buried next to him.[136] Tatum was inducted into the DownBeat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1964[137] and was given a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989.[138]\\nTatum was independent-minded and generous with his time and money.[139] Not wanting to be restricted by Musicians\\' Union rules, he avoided joining for as long as he could.[140] He also disliked anything that drew attention to his blindness: he did not want to be physically led and so planned his independent walk to the piano in clubs if possible.[141]\\nPeople who met Tatum consistently \"describe him as totally lacking in arrogance or ostentation\" and as being gentlemanly in behavior.[142] He avoided discussing his personal life and history in interviews[143] and in conversation with acquaintances.[144] Although marijuana use was common among musicians during his lifetime, Tatum was not linked to the use of illegal drugs.[145]\\nTatum was said to be more spontaneous and creative in free-form nocturnal sessions than in his scheduled performances.[146][147] Whereas in a professional setting he would often give audiences what they wanted – performances of songs that were similar to his recorded versions – but decline to play encores, in after-hours sessions with friends he would play the blues, improvise for long periods on the same sequence of chords, and move even more away from the melody of a composition.[148] Tatum also sometimes sang the blues in such settings, accompanying himself on piano.[149] Composer and historian Gunther Schuller describes \"a night-weary, sleepy, slurry voice, of lost love and sexual innuendos which would have shocked (and repelled) those \\'fans\\' who admired Tatum for his musical discipline and \\'classical\\' [piano] propriety\".[149]\\nIn after-hours performances, Tatum\\'s repertoire was much wider than for professional appearances,[150] for which his staples were American popular songs.[114] During his career, he also played his own arrangements of a few classical piano pieces, including Dvořák\\'s Humoresque and Massenet\\'s \"Élégie\",[151] and recorded around a dozen blues pieces.[152] Over time, he added to his repertoire – by the late 1940s, most of the new pieces were medium-tempo ballads but also included compositions that presented him with harmonic challenges, such as the simplicity of \"Caravan\" and complexity of \"Have You Met Miss Jones?\"[153] He did not add to the classical pieces he had used earlier.[153]\\nSaxophonist Benny Green wrote that Tatum was the only jazz musician to \"attempt to conceive a style based upon all styles, to master the mannerisms of all schools, and then synthesize those into something personal\".[154] Tatum was able to transform the styles of preceding jazz piano through virtuosity: where other pianists had employed repetitive rhythmic patterns and relatively simple decoration, he created \"harmonic sweeps of colour [...and] unpredictable and ever-changing shifts of rhythm.\"[155]\\nMusicologist Lewis Porter identified three aspects of Tatum\\'s playing that a casual listener might miss: the dissonance in his chords; his advanced use of substitute chord progressions; and his occasional use of bitonality (playing in two keys at the same time).[156] There are examples on record of the last of these going back to 1934, making Tatum the furthest harmonically out of jazz musicians until Lennie Tristano.[156] On occasion, the bitonality was against what another musician was playing, as in \"Lonesome Graveyard Blues\" with guitarist Oscar Moore.[156][157] Prior to Tatum, jazz harmony was mainly triadic, with flattened sevenths and infrequent ninths; he went beyond this, influenced by the harmonies of Debussy and Ravel.[158] He incorporated upper intervals such as elevenths and thirteenths,[159] and added tenths (and greater intervals) to the left-hand vocabulary of the earlier stride piano style.[160]\\nTatum had a different way of improvising from what is typical in modern jazz.[109] He did not try to create new melodic lines over a harmonic progression; instead, he implied or played the original melody or fragments of it, while superimposing countermelodies and new phrases to create new structures based around variation.[109][153] \"The harmonic lines may be altered, reworked or rhythmically rephrased for moments at a time, but they are still the base underneath Tatum\\'s superstructures. The melodic lines may be transformed into fresh shapes with only a note or a beat or a phrase particle retained to associate the new with the original, yet the melody remains, if only in the listener\\'s imagination.\"[162] This flexibility extended to his use of rhythm: regardless of the tempo, he could frequently alter the number of notes per beat and use other techniques at the same time to alter the rhythmic intensity and shape of his phrasing.[148] His rhythmic sense also allowed him to move away from the established tempo of a piece for extended periods without losing the beat.[163]\\nFor critic Martin Williams, there was also the matter of the pianist\\'s sly humor when playing: \"when we fear he is reaching the limits of romantic bombast, a quirky phrase, an exaggerated ornament will remind us that Tatum may be having us on. He is also inviting us to share the joke and heartily kidding himself as well as the concert hall traditions to which he alludes.\"[153]\\nPrior to the 1940s, Tatum\\'s style was based on popular song form, which often meant two bars of melodic development followed by two more melodically static bars, which he filled with rapid runs or arpeggios.[149] From the 1940s, he progressively lengthened the runs to eight or more bars, sometimes continuing them across the natural eight-bar boundaries within a composition\\'s structure, and began to use a harder, more aggressive attack.[149] He also increased the frequency of harmonic substitutions and the variety of musical devices played by his left hand, and developed a greater harmonic and contrapuntal balance across the piano\\'s upper and lower registers.[164] Schuller argues that Tatum was still developing towards the end of his life – he had greater rhythmic flexibility when playing at a given tempo, more behind the beat swing, more diverse forms of expression, and he employed far fewer musical quotations than earlier in his career.[165]\\nCritic Whitney Balliett commented on the overall form of Tatum\\'s style: \"his strange, multiplied chords, still largely unmatched by his followers, his laying on of two and three and four melodic levels at once [...] was orchestral and even symphonic.\"[163] This style was not one that could be adapted to the form of bebop: \"the orchestral approach to the keyboard [...] was too thick, too textured to work in the context of a bebop rhythm section.\"[166]\\nTatum\\'s approach has also been criticized on other grounds.[83] Pianist Keith Jarrett objected to Tatum playing too many notes,[167] and a criticism of him in a band setting was that he often did not modify his playing, overwhelming the other musicians and appearing to compete with any soloist that he was ostensibly supporting.[31][168] Clarinetist Buddy DeFranco said that playing with Tatum was \"like chasing a train\",[169] and the pianist himself said that a band got in his way.[170]\\nTatum was serious at the keyboard, not attempting crowd-pleasing gestures,[108] and he maintained a calm demeanor.[171] This accentuated the impact of his playing on observers,[171] as did his seemingly effortless technique, as pianist Hank Jones observed[23] – the apparently horizontal gliding of his hands across the keys stunned his contemporaries.[148] Tatum\\'s relatively straight-fingered technique, compared to the curvature taught in classical training, contributed to this visual impression: a critic wrote in 1935 that, when playing, \"Tatum\\'s hand is almost perfectly horizontal, and his fingers seem to actuate around a horizontal line drawn from wrist to finger tip.\"[172]\\nTatum was able to use his thumbs and little fingers to add melody lines while playing something else with his other fingers;[173] drummer Bill Douglass, who played with Tatum, commented that the pianist would \"do runs with these two fingers up here and then the other two fingers of the same hand playing something else down there. Two fingers on the black keys, and then the other two fingers would be playing something else on the white keys. He could do that in either hand\".[174] His large hands allowed him to play a left-hand trill with thumb and forefinger while also using his little finger to play a note an octave lower.[152] He was also capable of reaching twelfth intervals in either hand, and could play a succession of chords such as the illustrated examples at high speed.[152][note 3] He was able to play all of his chosen material in any key.[176]\\nTatum\\'s touch has also attracted attention: for Balliett, \"No pianist has ever hit notes more beautifully. Each one [...] was light and complete and resonant, like the letters on a finely printed page. Vast lower-register chords were unblurred, and his highest notes were polished silver.\"[163] Tatum could maintain these qualities of touch and tone even at the quickest tempos, when almost all other pianists would be incapable of playing the notes at all.[31] Pianist Chick Corea commented that \"Tatum is the only pianist I know of before Bill [Evans]  that also had that feather-light touch – even though he probably spent his early years playing on really bad instruments.\"[177]\\nAmong the musicians who said that Tatum could make a bad piano sound good were Billy Taylor[83] and Gerald Wiggins.[178] The latter revealed that Tatum was able to identify and avoid using any keys on a bad piano that were not working,[178] while guitarist Les Paul recounted that Tatum sometimes resorted to pulling up stuck keys with one hand, mid-performance, so that he could play them again.[179]\\nTatum\\'s improvisational style extended what was possible on jazz piano.[180] The virtuoso solo aspects of Tatum\\'s style were taken on by pianists such as Adam Makowicz, Simon Nabatov, Oscar Peterson, and Martial Solal.[181] Even musicians who played in very different styles, such as Bud Powell, Lennie Tristano, and Herbie Hancock, memorized and recreated some of his recordings to learn from them.[155] Although Powell was of the bebop movement, his prolific and exciting style showed Tatum\\'s influence.[182] Mary Lou Williams said, \"Tatum taught me how to hit my notes, how to control them without using pedals. And he showed me how to keep my fingers flat on the keys to get that clean tone.\"[183]\\nTatum\\'s influence went beyond the piano, however: his innovations in harmony and rhythm established new ground in jazz more broadly.[180] He made jazz musicians more aware of harmonic possibilities by changing the chords that he used with great frequency; this helped lay the foundations for the emergence of bebop in the 1940s.[158] His modern chord voicing and chord substitutions were also pioneering in jazz.[156]\\nOther musicians sought to transfer elements of Tatum\\'s pianistic virtuosity to their own instruments.[155] When newly arrived in New York, saxophonist Charlie Parker worked for three months as a dishwasher in a restaurant where Tatum was performing and often listened to the pianist.[184] \"Perhaps the most important idea Parker learned from Tatum was that any note could be made to fit in a chord if suitably resolved.\"[185] Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie was also affected by Tatum\\'s speed, harmony, and daring solos.[186] Vocalist Tony Bennett incorporated aspects of Tatum into his singing: \"I\\'d listen to his records almost daily and try to phrase like him. [...] I just take his phrasing and sing it that way.\"[187] Saxophonist Coleman Hawkins changed his playing style after hearing Tatum play in Toledo in the 1920s:[188] Hawkins\\'s \"arpeggio-based style and his growing vocabulary of chords, of passing chords and the relationships of chords, were confirmed and encouraged by his response to Art Tatum.\"[153] This style was hugely influential on the development of saxophone playing in jazz, and put it on course to becoming the dominant instrument in the music.[188]\\nSome musicians were negatively affected by exposure to Tatum\\'s abilities.[189] Many pianists tried to copy him and attain the same level of ability, hindering their progress towards finding their own style.[190] Others, including trumpeter Rex Stewart and pianists Oscar Peterson and Bobby Short, were overwhelmed and began to question their own abilities.[191] Some musicians, including Les Paul and Everett Barksdale, stopped playing the piano and switched to another instrument after hearing Tatum.[189]\\nThere is little published information available about Tatum\\'s life. One full-length biography has been published – Too Marvelous for Words (1994), written by James Lester.[192][note 4] This lack of detailed coverage may be attributable to Tatum\\'s life and music not fitting any of the established critical narratives or frameworks for jazz: many historians of the music have marginalised him for this, so \"not only is Tatum underrepresented in jazz criticism but his presence in jazz historiography seems largely to prompt no particular effort in historians beyond descriptive writing designed to summarize his pianistic approach\".[27]\\nCritics have expressed strong opinions about Tatum\\'s artistry: \"Some applaud Tatum as supremely inventive, while others say that he was boringly repetitive, and that he barely improvised.\"[156] Gary Giddins suggested that Tatum\\'s standing has not been elevated to the very highest level of jazz stars among the public because he did not employ the expected linear style of improvisation, and instead played in a way that listeners have to listen to with concentration, so he \"becalms many listeners into hapless indifference\".[196]\\nIn 1989, Tatum\\'s hometown of Toledo established the Art Tatum African American Resource Center in its Kent Branch Library.[197] It contains print and audio materials and microfiche, and organizes cultural programs, including festivals, concerts, and a gallery for local artists.[197]\\nIn 1993, Jeff Bilmes, an MIT student in the field of computational musicology coined the term \"tatum\", which was named in recognition of the pianist\\'s speed.[198][199] It has been defined as \"the smallest time interval between successive notes in a rhythmic phrase\",[198] and \"the fastest pulse present in a piece of music\".[200]\\nIn 2003, a historical marker was placed outside Tatum\\'s childhood home at 1123 City Park Avenue in Toledo, but by 2017 the unoccupied property was in a state of disrepair.[201] Also in Toledo, the Lucas County Arena unveiled a 27-feet-high sculpture, the \"Art Tatum Celebration Column\", in 2009.[202]\\n', 'Clark_Terry': '\\nClark Virgil Terry Jr.[1] (December 14, 1920 – February 21, 2015) was an American swing and bebop trumpeter, a pioneer of the flugelhorn in jazz, and a composer and educator.\\nHe played with Charlie Barnet (1947), Count Basie (1948–51),[2] Duke Ellington (1951–59),[2] Quincy Jones (1960), and Oscar Peterson (1964-96). He was with The Tonight Show Band on the Tonight Show  from 1962 to 1972. His career in jazz spanned more than 70 years, during which he became one of the most recorded jazz musicians, appearing on over 900 recordings. Terry also mentored Quincy Jones, Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, Wynton Marsalis, Pat Metheny, Dianne Reeves, and Terri Lyne Carrington.[3]\\nTerry was born to Clark Virgil Terry Sr. and Mary Terry in St. Louis, Missouri, on December 14, 1920.[1][2] He attended Vashon High School and began his professional career in the early 1940s, playing in local clubs. He served as a bandsman in the United States Navy during World War II. His first instrument was valve trombone.[4]\\nBlending the St. Louis tone with contemporary styles, Terry\\'s years with Basie and Ellington (who secretly recruited Terry away from Basie)[5] in the late 1940s and 1950s established his prominence. During his period with Ellington, he took part in many of the composer\\'s suites and acquired a reputation for his wide range of styles (from swing to hard bop), technical proficiency, and good humor. Terry influenced musicians including Miles Davis and Quincy Jones, both of whom acknowledged Terry\\'s influence during the early stages of their careers. Terry had informally taught Davis while they were still in St Louis,[6] and Jones during Terry\\'s frequent visits to Seattle with the Count Basie Sextet.[7]\\nAfter leaving Ellington in 1959, Clark\\'s international recognition soared when he accepted an offer from the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) to become a staff musician. He appeared for ten years on The Tonight Show as a member of the Tonight Show Band until 1972, first led by Skitch Henderson and later by Doc Severinsen, where his unique \"mumbling\" scat singing led to a hit with \"Mumbles\".[8] Terry was the first African American to become a regular in a band on a major US television network. He said later: \"We had to be models, because I knew we were in a test.... We couldn\\'t have a speck on our trousers. We couldn\\'t have a wrinkle in the clothes. We couldn\\'t have a dirty shirt.\"[9]\\nTerry continued to play with musicians such as trombonist J. J. Johnson and pianist Oscar Peterson,[10] and led a group with valve-trombonist Bob Brookmeyer that achieved some success in the early 1960s. In February 1965, Brookmeyer and Terry appeared on BBC2\\'s Jazz 625.[11] and in 1967, presented by Norman Granz, he was recorded at Poplar Town Hall, in the BBC series Jazz at the Philharmonic, alongside James Moody, Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman Hawkins, Benny Carter, Teddy Wilson, Bob Cranshaw, Louie Bellson and T-Bone Walker.[12]\\nIn the 1970s, Terry concentrated increasingly on the flugelhorn, which he played with a full, ringing tone. In addition to his studio work and teaching at jazz workshops, Terry toured regularly in the 1980s with small groups (including Peterson\\'s) and performed as the leader of his Big B-A-D Band (formed about 1970). After financial difficulties forced him to break up the Big B-A-D Band, he performed with bands such as the Unifour Jazz Ensemble. His humor and command of jazz trumpet styles are apparent in his \"dialogues\" with himself, on different instruments or on the same instrument, muted and unmuted.\\nFrom the 1970s through the 1990s, Terry performed at Carnegie Hall, Town Hall, and Lincoln Center, toured with the Newport Jazz All Stars and Jazz at the Philharmonic, and was featured with Skitch Henderson\\'s New York Pops Orchestra. In 1998, Terry recorded George Gershwin\\'s \"Let\\'s Call the Whole Thing Off\" for the Red Hot Organization\\'s compilation album Red Hot + Rhapsody, a tribute to George Gershwin, which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease.\\nIn November 1980, he was a headliner along with Anita O\\'Day, Lionel Hampton and Ramsey Lewis during the opening two-week ceremony performances celebrating the short-lived resurgence of the Blue Note Lounge at the Marriott O\\'Hare Hotel near Chicago.\\nPrompted early in his career by Billy Taylor, Clark and Milt Hinton bought instruments for and gave instruction to young hopefuls, which planted the seed that became Jazz Mobile in Harlem. This venture tugged at Terry\\'s greatest love: involving youth in the perpetuation of jazz. From 2000 onwards, he hosted Clark Terry Jazz Festivals on land and sea, held his own jazz camps, and appeared in more than fifty jazz festivals on six continents. Terry composed more than two hundred jazz songs and performed for eight U.S. Presidents.[13]\\nHe also had several recordings with major groups including the London Symphony Orchestra, the Dutch Metropole Orchestra, and the Chicago Jazz Orchestra, hundreds of high school and college ensembles, his own duos, trios, quartets, quintets, sextets, octets, and two big bands: Clark Terry\\'s Big Bad Band and Clark Terry\\'s Young Titans of Jazz.\\nIn February 2004, Terry guest starred as himself, on Little Bill, a children\\'s television series. Terry was a resident of Bayside, Queens, and Corona, Queens, New York, later moving to Haworth, New Jersey, and then Pine Bluff, Arkansas.[14][15]\\nHis autobiography was published in 2011.[3] Taylor Ho Bynum wrote in The New Yorker that it \"captures his gift for storytelling and his wry humor, especially in chronicling his early years on the road, with struggles through segregation and gigs in juke joints and carnivals, all while developing one of most distinctive improvisational voices in music history.\"[16]\\nAccording to his own website Terry was \"one of the most recorded jazz artists in history and had performed for eight American Presidents.\"[17]\\nIn April 2014, the documentary Keep on Keepin\\' On, followed Terry over four years, to document his  mentorship of the 23-year-old blind piano prodigy Justin Kauflin, as Kauflin  prepared to compete in an elite, international competition.[18]\\nIn December 2014 the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis and Cécile McLorin Salvant visited Terry, who had celebrated his 94th birthday on December 14, at the Jefferson Regional Medical Center. A lively rendition of \"Happy Birthday\" was played.[19]\\nOn February 13, 2015, it was announced that Terry had entered hospice care to manage his advanced diabetes.[20] He died on February 21, 2015.[21][22]\\nWriting in The New York Times,  Peter Keepnews said Terry \"was acclaimed for his impeccable musicianship, loved for his playful spirit and respected for his adaptability. Although his sound on both trumpet and the rounder-toned flugelhorn (which he helped popularize as a jazz instrument) was highly personal and easily identifiable, he managed to fit it snugly into a wide range of musical contexts.\"[23]\\nWriting in UK\\'s The Daily Telegraph, Martin Chilton said: \"Terry was a music educator and had a deep and lasting influence on the course of jazz. Terry became a mentor to generations of jazz players, including Miles Davis, Wynton Marsalis and composer-arranger Quincy Jones.\"[9]\\nInterviewing Terry in 2005, fellow jazz trumpeter Scotty Barnhart said he was \"... one of the most incredibly versatile musicians to ever live ... a jazz trumpet master that played with the greatest names in the history of the music ...\"[24]\\nSoutheast Missouri State University hosts the Clark Terry/Phi Mu Alpha Jazz Festival, an annual tribute to the musician. The festival began in 1998, and has grown in size every year. The festival showcases outstanding student musicians and guest artists at the university\\'s River Campus.[25][26]\\nThe University of New Hampshire hosts the Clark Terry Jazz Festival every year; it showcases middle- and high-school jazz musicians from all over New England.[27]\\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Clark Terry among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[28]\\nOver 250 awards, medals and honors, including:\\nWith Gene Ammons\\nWith Dave Bailey\\nWith Ray Bryant\\nWith Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis\\nWith Duke Ellington\\nWith Stan Getz\\nWith Dizzy Gillespie\\nWith Johnny Griffin\\nWith Johnny Hodges\\nWith Milt Jackson\\nWith J.

Many of his compositions have become jazz standards including \"In Your Own Sweet Way\" and \"The Duke\". Brubeck\\'s style ranged from refined to bombastic, reflecting both his mother\\'s classical training and his own improvisational skills. His music is known for employing unusual time signatures as well as superimposing contrasting rhythms, meters, and tonalities.\\nBrubeck experimented with time signatures throughout his career, recording \"Unsquare Dance\" in 74, \"World\\'s Fair\" in 134, and \"Blue Rondo à la Turk\" in 98. He was also a composer of orchestral and sacred music and wrote soundtracks for television, such as Mr. Broadway and the animated miniseries This Is America, Charlie Brown.\\nOften incorrectly attributed to Brubeck, the song \"Take Five\", which has become a jazz standard, was composed by Brubeck\\'s long-time musical partner, alto saxophonist Paul Desmond.[1] Appearing on one of the top-selling jazz albums, Time Out, and written in 54 time, \"Take Five\" has endured as a jazz classic associated with Brubeck.[2][3]\\nDave Brubeck was born in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Concord, California,[1] and grew up in a city located in the Mother Lode called Ione, California. His father, Peter Howard \"Pete\" Brubeck, was a cattle rancher. His mother, Elizabeth (née Ivey), who had studied piano in England under Myra Hess and intended to become a concert pianist, taught piano for extra money.[4]\\nBrubeck\\'s father had Swiss ancestry (the family surname was originally Brodbeck), and possibly Native American Modoc lineage,[5] while his maternal grandparents were English and German.[6][7][8] Brubeck did not intend to become a musician (his two older brothers, Henry and Howard, were already on that track), but he did take lessons from his mother. He could not read music during these early lessons, attributing the difficulty to poor eyesight, but \"faked\" his way through well enough that his deficiency went mostly unnoticed.[9]\\nPlanning to work with his father on their ranch, Brubeck entered the College of the Pacific in Stockton, California to study veterinary science. He switched his major to music at the urging of the head of zoology, Dr. Arnold, who told him \"Brubeck, your mind\\'s not here. It\\'s across the lawn in the conservatory. Please go there. Stop wasting my time and yours.\"[10] Later, Brubeck was nearly expelled when one of his professors discovered that he could not read music on sight. Several others came forward, arguing that his ability to write counterpoint and harmony more than compensated, and demonstrated his skill with music notation. The college was still concerned, and agreed to allow Brubeck graduate only after he promised never to teach piano.[11]\\nAfter graduating in 1942, Brubeck was drafted into the United States Army,  serving in Europe in the Third Army. He volunteered to play piano at a Red Cross show and was such a hit that he was spared from combat service and ordered to form a band. He created one of the U.S. armed forces\\' first racially integrated bands, \"The Wolfpack\".[11] It was in the military, in 1944, that Brubeck met Paul Desmond.[12] After serving nearly four years in the army, he returned to California for graduate study at Mills College in Oakland. He was a student of Darius Milhaud, who encouraged him to study fugue and orchestration, but not classical piano. While on active duty, he received two lessons from Arnold Schoenberg at UCLA in an attempt to connect with high modernist theory and practice.[13] However, the encounter did not end on good terms since Schoenberg believed that every note should be accounted for, an approach which Brubeck could not accept, although according to his son Chris Brubeck, there is a twelve-tone row in The Light in the Wilderness, Dave Brubeck\\'s first oratorio. In it, Jesus\\'s twelve disciples are introduced each singing their own individual notes; it is described as \"quite dramatic, especially when Judas starts singing \\'Repent\\' on a high and straining dissonant note\".[14]\\nJack Sheedy owned San Francisco-based Coronet Records, which had previously recorded area Dixieland bands. (This Coronet Records is distinct from the late 1950s New York-based budget label, and also from Australia-based Coronet Records.) In 1949, Sheedy was convinced to make the first recording of Brubeck\\'s octet and later his trio. But Sheedy was unable to pay his bills and in 1949 gave up his masters to his record stamping company, the Circle Record Company, owned by Max and Sol Weiss. The Weiss brothers soon changed the name of their business to Fantasy Records.\\nThe first Brubeck records sold well, and he made new records for Fantasy. Soon the company was shipping 40,000 to 50,000 copies of Brubeck records each quarter, making a good profit.[15]\\nIn 1951, Brubeck damaged several neck vertebrae and his spinal cord while diving into the surf in Hawaii. He would later remark that the rescue workers who responded had described him as a \"DOA\" (dead on arrival). Brubeck recovered after a few months, but suffered residual nerve pain in his hands for years after.[16] The injury also influenced his playing style towards complex, blocky chords rather than speedy, high-dexterity, single-note runs.\\nBrubeck organized the Dave Brubeck Quartet in 1951, with Paul Desmond on alto saxophone. They took up a long residency at San Francisco\\'s Black Hawk nightclub and gained great popularity touring college campuses, recording a series of albums with such titles as Jazz at Oberlin (1953), Jazz at the College of the Pacific (1953), and Brubeck\\'s debut on Columbia Records, Jazz Goes to College (1954).\\nWhen Brubeck signed with Fantasy Records, he thought he had a half interest in the company and worked as an A & R promoter for the label, encouraging the Weiss brothers to sign other contemporary jazz performers, including Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker and Red Norvo. When he discovered that all he owned was a half interest in his own recordings, he quit to sign with another label, Columbia Records.[17]\\nIn 1954, he was featured on the cover of Time, the second jazz musician to be so honored (the first was Louis Armstrong on February 21, 1949).[18] Brubeck personally found this acclaim embarrassing, since he considered Duke Ellington more deserving and was convinced that he had been favored as a Caucasian.[19] Ellington knocked on the door of Brubeck\\'s hotel room to show him the cover and Brubeck\\'s response was, \"It should have been you.\"[20]\\nEarly bassists for the group included Ron Crotty, Bob Bates and his brother Norman Bates; Lloyd Davis and Joe Dodge held the drum chair. In 1956 Brubeck hired drummer Joe Morello, who had been working with Marian McPartland; Morello\\'s presence made possible the rhythmic experiments that were to come. In 1958 African-American bassist Eugene Wright joined for the group\\'s U.S. Department of State tour of Europe and Asia.[21] The group visited Poland, Turkey, India, Ceylon, Pakistan, Iran and Iraq on behalf of the U.S. Government. They spent two weeks in Poland, giving thirteen concerts and visiting with Polish musicians and citizens as part of the People-to-People program.[22] Wright became a permanent member in 1959, making the \"classic\" Quartet\\'s personnel complete. During the late 1950s and early 1960s Brubeck canceled several concerts when the club owners or hall managers objected to presenting an integrated band. He also canceled a television appearance when he found out that the producers intended to keep Wright off-camera.[23]\\nIn 1959, the Dave Brubeck Quartet recorded Time Out, an album about which the record label was enthusiastic but which they were nonetheless hesitant to release. Featuring the cover art of S. Neil Fujita, the album contained all original compositions, almost none of which were in common time: 98, 54, 34, and 64 were used, inspired by Eurasian folk music they experienced during their 1958 Department of State sponsored tour.[24] Nonetheless, on the strength of these unusual time signatures (the album included \"Take Five\", \"Blue Rondo à la Turk\", and \"Three to Get Ready\"), it quickly went Platinum. It was the first jazz album to sell more than a million copies.[25]\\nTime Out was followed by several albums with a similar approach, including Time Further Out: Miro Reflections (1961), using more 54, 64, and 98, plus the first attempt at 74; Countdown—Time in Outer Space (dedicated to John Glenn, 1962), featuring 114 and more 74; Time Changes (1963), with much 34, 104 and 134; and Time In (1966).\\nThese albums (except Time In) were also known for using contemporary paintings as cover art, featuring the work of Joan Miró on Time Further Out, Franz Kline on Time in Outer Space, and Sam Francis on Time Changes.\\nOn a handful of albums in the early 1960s, clarinetist Bill Smith replaced Desmond. These albums were devoted to Smith\\'s compositions and thus had a somewhat different aesthetic than other Brubeck Quartet albums. Nonetheless, according to critic Ken Dryden, \"[Smith] proves himself very much in Desmond\\'s league with his witty solos\".[26] Smith was an old friend of Brubeck\\'s; they would record together, intermittently, from the 1940s until the final years of Brubeck\\'s career.\\nIn the early 1960s, Brubeck and his wife, Iola, developed a jazz musical, The Real Ambassadors, based in part on experiences they and their colleagues had during foreign tours on behalf of the Department of State. The soundtrack album, which featured Louis Armstrong, Lambert, Hendricks & Ross, and Carmen McRae was recorded in 1961; the musical was performed at the 1962 Monterey Jazz Festival.\\nAt its peak in the early 1960s, the Brubeck Quartet was releasing as many as four albums a year. Apart from the \"College\" and the \"Time\" series, Brubeck recorded four LP records featuring his compositions based on the group\\'s travels, and the local music they encountered. Jazz Impressions of the U.S.A. (1956, Morello\\'s debut with the group), Jazz Impressions of Eurasia (1958), Jazz Impressions of Japan (1964), and Jazz Impressions of New York (1964) are less well-known albums and they produced Brubeck standards such as \"Summer Song\", \"Brandenburg Gate\", \"Koto Song\", and \"Theme from Mr. Broadway\". (Brubeck wrote, and the Quartet performed, the theme song for this Craig Stevens CBS drama series; the music from the series became material for the New York album.) In 1961, Brubeck appeared in a few scenes of the British jazz/beat film All Night Long, which starred Patrick McGoohan and Richard Attenborough. Brubeck merely plays himself, with the film featuring close-ups of his piano fingerings. Brubeck performs \"It\\'s a Raggy Waltz\" from the Time Further Out album and duets briefly with bassist Charles Mingus in \"Non-Sectarian Blues\".\\nIn the early 1960s Dave Brubeck was the program director of WJZZ-FM radio (now WEZN-FM). He achieved his vision of an all-jazz format radio station along with his friend and neighbor John E. Metts, one of the first African Americans in senior radio management.\\nThe final studio album for Columbia by the Desmond/Wright/Morello quartet was Anything Goes (1966) featuring the songs of Cole Porter. A few concert recordings followed, and The Last Time We Saw Paris (1967) was the \"Classic\" Quartet\\'s swan-song.\\nBrubeck produced The Gates of Justice in 1968, a cantata mixing Biblical scripture with the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\\nIn 1971, the new senior management at Columbia Records decided not to renew Brubeck\\'s contract, as they wished to focus on rock music. He moved to Atlantic Records.[27]\\nBrubeck\\'s music was used in the 1985 film Ordeal by Innocence. He also composed for – and performed with his ensemble on – \"The NASA Space Station\", a 1988 episode of the CBS TV series This Is America, Charlie Brown.[28]\\nDave Brubeck married jazz lyricist Iola Whitlock in September 1942; the couple were married for 70 years, until his death in 2012. Iola died on March 12, 2014, from cancer in Wilton, Connecticut, at the age of 90.[29][30]\\nFour of Brubeck\\'s six children have been professional musicians. Darius, the eldest, is a pianist, producer, educator and performer. (He was named after Dave Brubeck\\'s mentor Darius Milhaud.[31]) Dan is a percussionist, Chris is a multi-instrumentalist and composer. Matthew, the youngest, is a cellist with an extensive list of composing and performance credits. Another son, Michael, died in 2009.[16][32] Brubeck\\'s children often joined him in concerts and in the recording studio.\\nBrubeck became a Catholic in 1980, shortly after completing the Mass To Hope which had been commissioned by Ed Murray, editor of the national Catholic weekly Our Sunday Visitor. Although he had spiritual interests before that time, he said, \"I didn\\'t convert to Catholicism, because I wasn\\'t anything to convert from.

In 2006, Brubeck was awarded the University of Notre Dame\\'s Laetare Medal, the oldest and most prestigious[34] honor given to American Catholics, during the University\\'s commencement. He performed \"Travellin\\' Blues\" for the graduating class of 2006.\\nBrubeck founded the Brubeck Institute with his wife, Iola, at their alma mater, the University of the Pacific in 2000. What began as a special archive, consisting of the personal document collection of the Brubecks, has since expanded to provide fellowships and educational opportunities in jazz for students, also leading to having one of the main streets on which the school resides named in his honor, Dave Brubeck Way.[35]\\nThe US Library of Congress conducted a conversation with Brubeck in April 2008: Jazz Conversation: Pianist, Composer Dave Brubeck.\\nThe main-belt asteroid 5079 Brubeck was named after Brubeck.[36]\\nBrubeck recorded five of the seven tracks of his album Jazz Goes to College in Ann Arbor. He returned to Michigan many times, including a performance at Hill Auditorium where he received a Distinguished Artist Award from the University of Michigan\\'s Musical Society in 2006. On April 8, 2008, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice presented Brubeck with a \"Benjamin Franklin Award for Public Diplomacy\" for offering an American \"vision of hope, opportunity and freedom\" through his music.[37] \"As a little girl I grew up on the sounds of Dave Brubeck because my dad was your biggest fan\", said Rice.[38] The State Department said in a statement that \"as a pianist, composer, cultural emissary and educator, Dave Brubeck\\'s life\\'s work exemplifies the best of America\\'s cultural diplomacy\".[37] At the ceremony Brubeck played a brief recital for the audience at the State Department.[37] \"I want to thank all of you because this honor is something that I never expected. Now I am going to play a cold piano with cold hands\", Brubeck stated.[37]\\nCalifornia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver announced on May 28, 2008, that Brubeck would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts. The induction ceremony occurred December 10, and he was inducted alongside eleven other famous Californians.[39]\\nIn 2008 Brubeck became a supporter of the Jazz Foundation of America in its mission to save the homes and the lives of elderly jazz and blues musicians, including those who had survived Hurricane Katrina.[40] Brubeck supported the Jazz Foundation by performing in its annual benefit concert \"A Great Night in Harlem\".[41] On October 18, 2008, Brubeck received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the prestigious Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York.\\nIn September 2009, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts announced Brubeck as a Kennedy Center Honoree for exhibiting excellence in performance arts.[42] The Kennedy Center Honors Gala took place on Sunday, December 6 (Brubeck\\'s 89th birthday), and was broadcast nationwide on CBS on December 29 at 9:00\\xa0pm EST. When the award was made, President Barack Obama recalled a 1971 concert Brubeck had given in Honolulu and said, \"You can\\'t understand America without understanding jazz, and you can\\'t understand jazz without understanding Dave Brubeck.\"[16]\\nOn September 20, 2009, at the Monterey Jazz Festival, Brubeck was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree (D.Mus. honoris causa) from Berklee College of Music.[43]\\nOn May 16, 2010, Brubeck was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree (honoris causa) from the George Washington University in Washington, D.C. The ceremony took place on the National Mall.[44]\\nOn July 5, 2010, Brubeck was awarded the Miles Davis Award at the Montreal International Jazz Festival.[45] In 2010, Bruce Ricker and Clint Eastwood produced Dave Brubeck: In His Own Sweet Way, a documentary about Brubeck for Turner Classic Movies (TCM) to commemorate his 90th birthday in December 2010.[46]\\nBrubeck died of heart failure on December 5, 2012, in Norwalk, Connecticut, one day before his 92nd birthday. He was on his way to a cardiology appointment, accompanied by his son Darius.[47] A birthday party concert had been planned for him with family and famous guests.[48] A memorial tribute was held in May 2013.[49]\\nThe Los Angeles Times noted that he \"was one of Jazz\\'s first pop stars\", even though he was not always happy with his fame. He felt uncomfortable, for example, that Time had featured him on the cover[50] before it did so for Duke Ellington, saying, \"It just bothered me.\"[51] The New York Times noted he had continued to play well into his old age, performing in 2011 and in 2010 only a month after getting a pacemaker, with Times music writer Nate Chinen commenting that Brubeck had replaced \"the old hammer-and-anvil attack with something almost airy\" and that his playing at the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York City was \"the picture of judicious clarity\".[32]\\nIn The Daily Telegraph, music journalist Ivan Hewett wrote: \"Brubeck didn\\'t have the réclame of some jazz musicians who lead tragic lives. He didn\\'t do drugs or drink. What he had was endless curiosity combined with stubbornness\", adding: \"His work list is astonishing, including oratorios, musicals and concertos, as well as hundreds of jazz compositions. This quiet man of jazz was truly a marvel.\"[52]\\nIn The Guardian, John Fordham said \"Brubeck\\'s real achievement was to blend European compositional ideas, very demanding rhythmic structures, jazz song-forms and improvisation in expressive and accessible ways. His son Chris told The Guardian \"when I hear Chorale, it reminds me of the very best Aaron Copland, something like Appalachian Spring. There\\'s a sort of American honesty to it.\"[53] Robert Christgau dubbed Brubeck the \"jazz hero of the rock and roll generation\".[54]\\nThe Economist wrote: \"Above all they found it hard to believe that the most successful jazz in America was being played by a family man, a laid-back Californian, modest, gentle and open, who would happily have been a rancher all his days—except that he couldn\\'t live without performing, because the rhythm of jazz, under all his extrapolation and exploration, was, he had discovered, the rhythm of his heart.\"[55]\\nThe Concord Boulevard Park in his hometown of Concord, California, was renamed to \"Dave Brubeck Memorial Park\" in his honor. Mayor Dan Helix favorably recalled one of his performances at the park, saying: \"He will be with us forever because his music will never die.\"[56]\\nWhile on tour performing \"Hot House\" in Toronto, Chick Corea and Gary Burton completed a tribute to Brubeck on the day of his death. Corea played \"Strange Meadow Lark\", from Brubeck\\'s album Time Out.[57]\\nBrubeck is interred at Umpawaug Cemetery in Redding, Connecticut.[58][59]\\nIn the United States, May 4 is informally observed as \"Dave Brubeck Day\". In the format most commonly used in the U.S., May 4 is written \"5/4\", recalling the time signature of \"Take Five\", Brubeck\\'s best known recording.[60] In September 2019, musicologist Stephen A. Crist\\'s book, Dave Brubeck\\'s Time Out, provided the first scholarly book length analysis of the seminal album. In addition to his musical analyses of each of the album\\'s original compositions, Crist provides insight into Brubeck\\'s career during a time he was rising to the top of the jazz charts.[61]\\nA new biography of Dave Brubeck, by the British writer Philip Clark, was published by Da Capo Press in the US and Headline Publishing Group in the UK on February 18, 2020.[62][63]\\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Dave Brubeck among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal Studios fire.[64]\\nWith Yo-Yo Ma\\nVarious artists\\n', 'Thelonious_Monk': '\\nThelonious Sphere Monk[2] (/θəˈloʊniəs/, October 10, 1917[3]\\xa0– February 17, 1982) was an American jazz pianist and composer. He had a unique improvisational style and made numerous contributions to the standard jazz repertoire, including \"\\'Round Midnight\", \"Blue Monk\", \"Straight, No Chaser\", \"Ruby, My Dear\", \"In Walked Bud\", and \"Well, You Needn\\'t\". Monk is the second-most-recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington.[4]\\nMonk\\'s compositions and improvisations feature dissonances and angular melodic twists and are consistent with his unorthodox approach to the piano, which combined a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of switched key releases, silences, and hesitations. His style was not universally appreciated; the poet and jazz critic Philip Larkin dismissed him as \"the elephant on the keyboard\".[5]\\nMonk was renowned for a distinct look which included suits, hats, and sunglasses. He was also noted for an idiosyncratic habit during performances: while other musicians continued playing, Monk would stop, stand up, and dance for a few moments before returning to the piano.[6]\\nMonk is one of five jazz musicians to have been featured on the cover of Time magazine (the others being Louis Armstrong, Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington and Wynton Marsalis).[7][8]\\nThelonious Sphere Monk was born two years after his sister Marion on October 10, 1917, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and was the son of Thelonious and Barbara Monk. His poorly written birth certificate misspelled his first name as \"Thelious\"[9] or \"Thelius\". It also did not list his middle name, taken from his maternal grandfather, Sphere Batts.[10] His brother, Thomas, was born in January 1920. In 1922, the family moved to the Phipps Houses, 243 West 63rd Street, in Manhattan, New York City; the neighborhood was known as San Juan Hill because of the many African-American veterans of the Spanish–American War who lived there (urban renewal displaced the long-time residents of the community, who saw their neighborhood replaced by the Amsterdam Housing Projects and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, though the Phipps Houses remained). Monk started playing the piano at the age of six, taking lessons from a neighbor, Alberta Simmons, whose own performing career was cut short by raising children and who taught him stride playing in the style of Fats Waller, James P. Johnson and Eubie Blake. His mother also taught him to play some hymns, and he would sometimes accompany her singing at church.  He attended Stuyvesant High School, a public school for gifted students, but did not graduate.[11]\\nAt 17, Monk toured with an evangelist, playing the church organ, and in his late teens he began to find work playing jazz.[6] In the early to mid-1940s, he was the house pianist at Minton\\'s Playhouse, a Manhattan nightclub.[6] Much of Monk\\'s style (in the Harlem stride tradition) was developed during his time at Minton\\'s, when he participated in after-hours cutting contests, which featured many leading jazz soloists of the time. Monk\\'s musical work at Minton\\'s was crucial in the formulation of bebop, which would be furthered by other artists, including Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Christian, Kenny Clarke, Charlie Parker, and, later, Miles Davis.[12] Monk is believed to be the pianist featured on recordings Jerry Newman made around 1941 at the club. Monk\\'s style at this time was later described as \"hard-swinging,\" with the addition of runs in the style of Art Tatum. Monk\\'s stated influences included Duke Ellington, James P. Johnson, and other early stride pianists. According to the documentary Thelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser, Monk lived in the same neighborhood in New York City as Johnson and knew him as a teenager.\\nMary Lou Williams, who mentored Monk and his contemporaries, spoke of Monk\\'s rich inventiveness in this period, and how such invention was vital for musicians, since at the time it was common for fellow musicians to incorporate overheard musical ideas into their own works without giving due credit. \"So, the boppers worked out a music that was hard to steal. I\\'ll say this for the \\'leeches,\\' though: they tried. I\\'ve seen them in Minton\\'s busily writing on their shirt cuffs or scribbling on the tablecloth. And even our own guys, I\\'m afraid, did not give Monk the credit he had coming. Why, they even stole his idea of the beret and bop glasses.\"[12]\\nIn 1944 Monk made his first studio recordings with the Coleman Hawkins Quartet. Hawkins was one of the earliest established jazz musicians to promote Monk, and the pianist later returned the favor by inviting Hawkins to join him on a 1957 session with John Coltrane.\\nIn 1947, Ike Quebec introduced Monk to Lorraine Gordon and her first husband, Alfred Lion, the founder of Blue Note Records. From then on, Gordon preached his genius to the jazz world with unrelenting passion. Shortly after meeting Gordon and Lion, Monk made his first recordings as a leader for Blue Note (later anthologized on Genius of Modern Music, Vol. 1), which showcased his talents as a composer of original melodies for improvisation. Monk married Nellie Smith the same year, and on December 27, 1949 the couple had a son, T. S. Monk (called Toot), who became a jazz drummer. A daughter, Barbara (affectionately known as Boo-Boo), was born on September 5, 1953 and died of cancer in 1984.\\nIn her autobiography, Gordon spoke of the utter lack of interest in Monk\\'s recordings, which translated to poor sales. \"I went to Harlem and those record stores didn\\'t want Monk or me. I\\'ll never forget one particular owner, I can still see him and his store on Seventh Avenue and 125th Street. \\'He can\\'t play lady, what are you doing up here? The guy has two left hands.\\' \\'You just wait,\\' I\\'d say. \\'This man\\'s a genius, you don\\'t know anything.\\'\"[13]\\nDue to Monk\\'s reticence, Gordon became his mouthpiece to the public. In February 1948, she wrote to Ralph Ingersoll, the editor of the newspaper PM, and described Monk as \"a genius living here in the heart of New York, whom nobody knows\". As a result, one of PM\\'s best writers visited Monk to do a feature on him, but Monk wouldn\\'t speak to the reporter unless Gordon was in the room with him. In September of the same year, Lorraine approached Max Gordon, the owner and founder of the Village Vanguard jazz club, and secured Monk his first gig there. Monk was showcased at the club for a week, but not a single person came.[13]\\nIn August 1951, New York City police searched a parked car occupied by Monk and his friend Bud Powell. They found narcotics in the car, presumed to have belonged to Powell. Monk refused to testify against his friend, so the police confiscated his New York City Cabaret Card. Without this, Monk was nominally unable to play in any New York venue where liquor was served. Although this severely restricted his ability to perform for several years, a coterie of musicians led by Randy Weston introduced Monk to Black-owned bars and clubs in Brooklyn that flouted the law, enabling the pianist to play little-advertised, one-night engagements throughout the borough with a modicum of regularity. Monk spent most of the early and mid-1950s composing, recording at Blue Note, and performing at theaters, outer borough clubs and out-of-town venues.\\nAfter intermittent recording sessions for Blue Note from 1947 to 1952, Monk was under contract to Prestige Records for the following two years. With Prestige, he cut several highly significant, but at the time under-recognized, albums, including collaborations with the saxophonist Sonny Rollins and the drummers Art Blakey and Max Roach. In 1954, Monk participated in a Christmas Eve session, which produced most of the albums Bags\\' Groove and Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants by Davis. In his autobiography, Miles, Davis claimed that the alleged anger and tension between them did not take place and that the claims of blows being exchanged were \"rumors\" and a \"misunderstanding\".[14]\\nIn 1954, Monk paid his first visit to Paris. As well as performing at concerts, he recorded a solo piano session for French radio (later issued as an album by Disques Vogue). Backstage, Mary Lou Williams introduced him to Baroness Pannonica \"Nica\" de Koenigswarter, a member of the Rothschild family and a patroness of several New York City jazz musicians. She was a close friend for the rest of Monk\\'s life: she \"served as a surrogate wife right alongside Monk\\'s equally devoted actual wife, Nellie\"[15] and \"paid Monk\\'s bills, dragged him to an endless array of doctors, put him and his family up in her own home and, when necessary, helped Nellie institutionalize him. In 1958 Monk and the baroness were stopped by the police in Delaware. When a small amount of marijuana was discovered, she took the rap for her friend and even served a few nights in jail.\"[15]\\nBy the time of his signing to Riverside, Monk was highly regarded by his peers and by some critics, but his records remained poor sellers and his music was still regarded as too \"difficult\" for more mainstream acceptance. Indeed, with Monk\\'s consent, Riverside had managed to buy out his previous Prestige contract for a mere $108.24. He willingly recorded two albums of jazz standards as a means of increasing his profile: Thelonious Monk Plays Duke Ellington (1955) and The Unique Thelonious Monk (1956).\\nOn Brilliant Corners, recorded in late 1956, Monk mainly performed his own music. The complex title track, which featured Rollins, was so difficult to play that the final version had to be edited together from multiple takes. The album, however, was largely regarded as the first commercial success for Monk.\\nAfter having his cabaret card restored, Monk relaunched his New York career with a landmark six-month residency at the Five Spot Cafe in the East Village neighborhood of New York beginning in June 1957,[6] leading a quartet with John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Wilbur Ware on bass, and Shadow Wilson on drums. Little of this group\\'s music was documented owing to contractual problems: Coltrane was signed to Prestige at the time, but Monk refused to return to his former label. One studio session by the quartet was made for Riverside, three tunes which were not released until 1961 by the subsidiary label Jazzland along with outtakes from a larger group recording with Coltrane and Hawkins, those results appearing in 1957 as the album Monk\\'s Music. An amateur fan recording from the Five Spot (a later September 1958 reunion with Coltrane sitting in for Johnny Griffin) was issued on Blue Note in 1993; and a pristine quality recording of the quartet performing at a Carnegie Hall concert on November 29 was recorded in high fidelity by Voice of America engineers, rediscovered in the collection of the Library of Congress in 2005 and released by Blue Note.\\n\"Crepuscule with Nellie,\" recorded in 1957, \"was Monk\\'s only, what\\'s called through-composed composition, meaning that there is no improvising. It is Monk\\'s concerto, if you will, and in some ways it speaks for itself. But he wrote it very, very carefully and very deliberately and really struggled to make it sound the way it sounds. [... I]t was his love song for Nellie,\" said the author of the \"definitive Monk biography,\"[6] Robin Kelley.[16]\\nThe Five Spot residency ended Christmas 1957; Coltrane left to rejoin Davis\\'s group, and the band was effectively disbanded. Monk did not form another long-term band until June 1958 when he began a second residency at the Five Spot, again with a quartet, this time with Griffin (and later Charlie Rouse) on tenor, Ahmed Abdul-Malik on bass, and Roy Haynes on drums.\\nOn October 15, 1958, en route to a week-long engagement for the quartet at the Comedy Club in Baltimore, Maryland, Monk and de Koenigswarter were detained by police in Wilmington, Delaware. When Monk refused to answer the policemen\\'s questions or cooperate with them, they beat him with a blackjack. Although the police were authorized to search the vehicle and found narcotics in suitcases held in the trunk of the Baroness\\'s car, Judge Christie of the Delaware Superior Court ruled that the unlawful detention of the pair, and the beating of Monk, rendered the consent to the search void as given under duress.[17]\\nAfter extended negotiations, Monk signed in 1962 with Columbia Records, one of the big four American record labels of the day. Monk\\'s relationship with Riverside had soured over disagreements concerning royalty payments and had concluded with a brace of European live albums; he had not recorded a studio album since 5 by Monk by 5 in June 1959.\\nWorking with producer Teo Macero on his debut for Columbia,[18] the sessions in the first week of November had a lineup that had been with him for two years: tenor saxophonist Rouse (who worked with Monk from 1959 to 1970), bassist John Ore, and drummer Frankie Dunlop. Monk\\'s Dream, his first Columbia album, was released in 1963.\\nColumbia\\'s resources allowed Monk to be promoted more heavily than earlier in his career. Monk\\'s Dream became the best-selling LP of his lifetime,[19] and on February 28, 1964, he appeared on the cover of Time magazine, being featured in the article \"The Loneliest Monk\".[20] The cover article was originally supposed to run in November 1963, but it was postponed due to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.[6] According to biographer Kelley, the 1964 Time appearance came because \"Barry Farrell, who wrote the cover story, wanted to write about a jazz musician and almost by default Monk was chosen, because they thought Ray Charles and Miles Davis were too controversial. ... [Monk] wasn\\'t so political. ...[O]f course, I challenge that [in the biography],\" Kelley wrote.[16]\\nMonk continued to record studio albums, including Criss Cross, also in 1963, and Underground, in 1968. But by the Columbia years his compositional output was limited, and only his final Columbia studio record, Underground, featured a substantial number of new tunes, including his only 34 time piece, \"Ugly Beauty\".\\nAs had been the case with Riverside, his period with Columbia contains many live albums, including Miles and Monk at Newport (1963), Live at the It Club, and Live at the Jazz Workshop, the latter two recorded in 1964, the last not being released until 1982. After the departure of Ore and Dunlop, the remainder of the rhythm section in Monk\\'s quartet during the bulk of his Columbia period was Larry Gales on bass and Ben Riley on drums, both of whom joined in 1964. Along with Rouse, they remained with Monk for over four years, his longest-serving band.\\nMonk had disappeared from the scene by the mid-1970s and made only a small number of appearances during the final decade of his life. His last studio recordings as a leader were made in November 1971 for the English Black Lion label, near the end of a worldwide tour with the Giants of Jazz, a group which included Gillespie, Kai Winding, Sonny Stitt, Al McKibbon, and Art Blakey. Bassist McKibbon, who had known Monk for over twenty years and played on his final tour in 1971, later said: \"On that tour, Monk said about two words. I mean literally maybe two words. He didn\\'t say \\'Good morning,\\' \\'Goodnight,\\' \\'What time?\\' Nothing. Why, I don\\'t know. He sent word back after the tour was over that the reason he couldn\\'t communicate or play was that Art Blakey and I were so ugly.\"[21]  A different side of Monk is revealed in Lewis Porter\\'s biography, John Coltrane: His Life and Music; Coltrane states: \"Monk is exactly the opposite of Miles [Davis]: he talks about music all the time, and he wants so much for you to understand that if, by chance, you ask him something, he\\'ll spend hours if necessary to explain it to you.\"[22] Blakey reports that Monk was excellent at both chess and checkers.[23]\\nThe documentary film Thelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser (1988) attributes Monk\\'s quirky behavior to mental illness. In the film, Monk\\'s son says that his father sometimes did not recognize him, and he reports that Monk was hospitalized on several occasions owing to an unspecified mental illness that worsened in the late 1960s. No reports or diagnoses were ever publicized, but Monk would often become excited for two or three days, then pace for days after that, after which he would withdraw and stop speaking. Doctors recommended electroconvulsive therapy as a treatment option for Monk\\'s illness, but his family would not allow it; antipsychotics and lithium were prescribed instead.[24][25]  Other theories abound: Leslie Gourse, author of the book Straight, No Chaser: The Life and Genius of Thelonious Monk (1997), reported that at least one of Monk\\'s psychiatrists failed to find evidence of manic depression (bipolar disorder) or schizophrenia. Another doctor maintains that Monk was misdiagnosed and prescribed drugs during his hospital stay that may have caused brain damage.[24]\\nAs his health declined, Monk\\'s last six years were spent as a guest in the Weehawken, New Jersey, home of his long-standing patron and friend, Pannonica de Koenigswarter, who nursed Monk during his final illness. She proved to be a steadfast presence, as did his own wife Nellie, especially as his life descended into further isolation.[12] Monk did not play the piano during this time, even though one was present in his room, and he spoke to few visitors. He died of a stroke on February 17, 1982, and was buried in Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.\\n— Steve Lacy [26]\\nMonk famously said, \"The piano ain\\'t got no wrong notes.\"[27]\\nAccording to Bebop: The Music and Its Players author Thomas Owens, \"Monk\\'s usual piano touch was harsh and percussive, even in ballads. He often attacked the keyboard anew for each note, rather than striving for any semblance of legato. Often seemingly unintentional seconds embellish his melodic lines, giving the effect of someone playing while wearing work gloves. [...] He hit the keys with fingers held flat rather than in a natural curve, and held his free fingers high above the keys. [...] Sometimes  he hit a single key with more than one finger, and divided single-line melodies between the two hands.\"[28] In contrast with this unorthodox approach to playing, he could play runs and arpeggios with great speed and accuracy.[28] He also had good finger independence, allowing him to play a melodic line and a trill simultaneously in his right hand.[28]\\nMonk often used parts of whole tone scales, played either ascending or descending, and covering several octaves.[28] He also had extended improvisations that featured parallel sixths (he also used these in the themes of some of his compositions).[29] His solos also feature space and long notes.[30] Unusually for a bebop-based pianist, as an accompanist and on solo performances he often employed a left-hand stride pattern.[30] A further characteristic of his work as an accompanist was his tendency to stop playing, leaving a soloist with just bass and drums for support.[30] Monk had a particular proclivity for the key of B flat. All of his many blues compositions, including \"Blue Monk,\" \"Misterioso,\" \"Blues Five Spot,\" and \"Functional,\" were composed in B flat; in addition, his signature theme, \"Thelonious,\" largely consists of an insistently repeated B-flat tone.[31]\\nThe following tribute albums to Monk have been released:\\nIn 1993, he was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[35] In 2006, he was awarded a special Pulitzer Prize for \"a body of distinguished and innovative musical composition that has had a significant and enduring impact on the evolution of jazz\".[36]\\nThe Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz was established in 1986 by the Monk family and Maria Fisher. Its mission is to offer public school-based jazz education programs for young people around the globe, helping students develop imaginative thinking, creativity, curiosity, a positive self-image, and a respect for their own and others\\' cultural heritage. In addition to hosting an annual International Jazz Competition since 1987, the institute also helped, through its partnership with UNESCO, designate April 30, 2012, as the first annual International Jazz Day.\\nMonk was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009.[37]\\n', 'Charles_Mingus': '\\nCharles Mingus Jr. (April 22, 1922 – January 5, 1979) was an American jazz double bassist, pianist, composer and bandleader. A major proponent of collective improvisation, he is considered to be one of the greatest jazz musicians and composers in history,[1] with a career spanning three decades and collaborations with other jazz legends such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Dannie Richmond, and Herbie Hancock.\\nMingus\\'s compositions continue to be played by contemporary musicians ranging from the repertory bands Mingus Big Band, Mingus Dynasty, and Mingus Orchestra, to the high school students who play the charts and compete in the Charles Mingus High School Competition.[2] In 1993, the Library of Congress acquired Mingus\\'s collected papers—including scores, sound recordings, correspondence and photos—in what they described as \"the most important acquisition of a manuscript collection relating to jazz in the Library\\'s history\".\\nCharles Mingus was born in Nogales, Arizona. His father, Charles Mingus Sr., was a sergeant in the U.S. Army.[3] Mingus was largely raised in the Watts area of Los Angeles. His maternal grandfather was a Chinese British subject from Hong Kong, and his maternal grandmother was an African-American from the southern United States. Mingus was the third great-grandson of the family\\'s founding patriarch who was, by most accounts, a German immigrant. His ancestors included German American, African American, and Native American.[4][5][6]\\nIn Mingus\\'s autobiography Beneath the Underdog his mother was described as \"the daughter of an English/Chinese man and a South-American woman\", and his father was the son \"of a black farm worker and a Swedish woman\". Charles Mingus Sr. claims to have been raised by his mother and her husband as a white person until he was fourteen, when his mother revealed to her family that the child\\'s true father was a black slave, after which he had to run away from his family and live on his own. The autobiography does not confirm whether Charles Mingus Sr. or Mingus himself believed this story was true, or whether it was merely an embellished version of the Mingus family\\'s lineage.[7]\\nHis mother allowed only church-related music in their home, but Mingus developed an early love for other music, especially Duke Ellington. He studied trombone, and later cello, although he was unable to follow the cello professionally because, at the time, it was nearly impossible for a black musician to make a career of classical music, and the cello was not yet accepted as a jazz instrument. Despite this, Mingus was still attached to the cello; as he studied bass with Red Callender in the late 1930s, Callender even commented that the cello was still Mingus\\'s main instrument. In Beneath the Underdog, Mingus states that he did not actually start learning bass until Buddy Collette accepted him into his swing band under the stipulation that he be the band\\'s bass player.[7]\\nDue to a poor education, the young Mingus could not read musical notation quickly enough to join the local youth orchestra. This had a serious impact on his early musical experiences, leaving him feeling ostracized from the classical music world. These early experiences, in addition to his lifelong confrontations with racism, were reflected in his music, which often focused on themes of racism, discrimination and (in)justice.[6]\\nMuch of the cello technique he learned was applicable to double bass when he took up the instrument in high school. He studied for five years with Herman Reinshagen, principal bassist of the New York Philharmonic, and compositional techniques with Lloyd Reese.[8] Throughout much of his career, he played a bass made in 1927 by the German maker Ernst Heinrich Roth.\\nBeginning in his teen years, Mingus was writing quite advanced pieces; many are similar to Third Stream because they incorporate elements of classical music. A number of them were recorded in 1960 with conductor Gunther Schuller, and released as Pre-Bird, referring to Charlie \"Bird\" Parker; Mingus was one of many musicians whose perspectives on music were altered by Parker into \"pre- and post-Bird\" eras.[citation needed]\\nMingus gained a reputation as a bass prodigy. His first major professional job was playing with former Ellington clarinetist Barney Bigard. He toured with Louis Armstrong in 1943, and by early 1945 was recording in Los Angeles in a band led by Russell Jacquet, which also included Teddy Edwards, Maurice Simon, Bill Davis, and Chico Hamilton, and in May that year, in Hollywood, again with Teddy Edwards, in a band led by Howard McGhee.[9]\\nHe then played with Lionel Hampton\\'s band in the late 1940s; Hampton performed and recorded several of Mingus\\'s pieces. A popular trio of Mingus, Red Norvo and Tal Farlow in 1950 and 1951 received considerable acclaim, but Mingus\\'s race caused problems with club owners and he left the group. Mingus was briefly a member of Ellington\\'s band in 1953, as a substitute for bassist Wendell Marshall. Mingus\\'s notorious temper led to his being one of the few musicians personally fired by Ellington (Bubber Miley and drummer Bobby Durham are among the others), after a back-stage fight between Mingus and Juan Tizol.[10]\\nAlso in the early 1950s, before attaining commercial recognition as a bandleader, Mingus played gigs with Charlie Parker, whose compositions and improvisations greatly inspired and influenced him. Mingus considered Parker the greatest genius and innovator in jazz history, but he had a love-hate relationship with Parker\\'s legacy. Mingus blamed the Parker mythology for a derivative crop of pretenders to Parker\\'s throne. He was also conflicted and sometimes disgusted by Parker\\'s self-destructive habits and the romanticized lure of drug addiction they offered to other jazz musicians. In response to the many sax players who imitated Parker, Mingus titled a song \"If Charlie Parker Were a Gunslinger, There\\'d Be a Whole Lot of Dead Copycats\" (released on Mingus Dynasty as \"Gunslinging Bird\").[11]\\nMingus was married four times. His wives were Jeanne Gross, Lucille (Celia) Germanis, Judy Starkey, and Susan Graham Ungaro.[4]\\nIn 1961, Mingus spent time staying at the house of his mother\\'s sister (Louise) and her husband, Fess Williams in Jamaica, Queens.[12]  Subsequently, Mingus invited Williams to play at the 1962 Town Hall Concert.[13]\\nIn 1952 Mingus co-founded Debut Records with Max Roach so he could conduct his recording career as he saw fit. The name originated from his desire to document unrecorded young musicians. Despite this, the best-known recording the company issued was of the most prominent figures in bebop. On May 15, 1953, Mingus joined Dizzy Gillespie, Parker, Bud Powell, and Roach for a concert at Massey Hall in Toronto, which is the last recorded documentation of Gillespie and Parker playing together. After the event, Mingus chose to overdub his barely audible bass part back in New York; the original version was issued later. The two 10\" albums of the Massey Hall concert (one featured the trio of Powell, Mingus and Roach) were among Debut Records\\' earliest releases. Mingus may have objected to the way the major record companies treated musicians, but Gillespie once commented that he did not receive any royalties \"for years and years\" for his Massey Hall appearance. The records, however, are often regarded as among the finest live jazz recordings.\\nOne story has it that Mingus was involved in a notorious incident while playing a 1955 club date billed as a \"reunion\" with Parker, Powell, and Roach. Powell, who suffered from alcoholism and mental illness (possibly exacerbated by a severe police beating and electroshock treatments), had to be helped from the stage, unable to play or speak coherently. As Powell\\'s incapacitation became apparent, Parker stood in one spot at a microphone, chanting \"Bud Powell...Bud Powell...\" as if beseeching Powell\\'s return. Allegedly, Parker continued this incantation for several minutes after Powell\\'s departure, to his own amusement and Mingus\\'s exasperation. Mingus took another microphone and announced to the crowd, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, please don\\'t associate me with any of this. This is not jazz.  These are sick people.\"[12] This was Parker\\'s last public performance; about a week later he died after years of substance abuse.\\nMingus often worked with a mid-sized ensemble (around 8–10 members) of rotating musicians known as the Jazz Workshop. Mingus broke new ground, constantly demanding that his musicians be able to explore and develop their perceptions on the spot. Those who joined the Workshop (or Sweatshops as they were colorfully dubbed by the musicians) included Pepper Adams, Jaki Byard, Booker Ervin, John Handy, Jimmy Knepper, Charles McPherson and Horace Parlan. Mingus shaped these musicians into a cohesive improvisational machine that in many ways anticipated free jazz. Some musicians dubbed the workshop a \"university\" for jazz.\\nThe decade that followed  is generally regarded as Mingus\\'s most productive and fertile period. Over a ten-year period, he made 30 records for a number of labels (Atlantic, Candid, Columbia, Impulse and others), a pace perhaps unmatched by any other musicians except Ellington.[citation needed]\\nMingus had already recorded around ten albums as a bandleader, but 1956 was a breakthrough year for him, with the release of Pithecanthropus Erectus, arguably his first major work as both a bandleader and composer. Like Ellington, Mingus wrote songs with specific musicians in mind, and his band for Erectus included adventurous musicians: piano player Mal Waldron, alto saxophonist Jackie McLean and the Sonny Rollins-influenced tenor of J. R. Monterose. The title song is a ten-minute tone poem, depicting the rise of man from his hominid roots (Pithecanthropus erectus) to an eventual downfall. A section of the piece was free improvisation, free of structure or theme.\\nAnother album from this period, The Clown (1957 also on Atlantic Records), the title track of which features narration by humorist Jean Shepherd, was the first to feature drummer Dannie Richmond, who remained his preferred drummer until Mingus\\'s death in 1979. The two men formed one of the most impressive and versatile rhythm sections in jazz. Both were accomplished performers seeking to stretch the boundaries of their music while staying true to its roots. When joined by pianist Jaki Byard, they were dubbed \"The Almighty Three\".[14]\\nIn 1959 Mingus and his jazz workshop musicians recorded one of his best-known albums, Mingus Ah Um. Even in a year of standout masterpieces, including Dave Brubeck\\'s Time Out, Miles Davis\\'s Kind of Blue, John Coltrane\\'s Giant Steps, and Ornette Coleman\\'s prophetic The Shape of Jazz to Come, this was a major achievement, featuring such classic Mingus compositions as \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\" (an elegy to Lester Young) and the vocal-less version of \"Fables of Faubus\" (a protest against segregationist Arkansas governor Orval Faubus that features double-time sections). Also during 1959, Mingus recorded the album Blues & Roots, which was released the following year. As Mingus explained in his liner notes: \"I was born swinging and clapped my hands in church as a little boy, but I\\'ve grown up and I like to do things other than just swing. But blues can do more than just swing.\"\\nMingus witnessed Ornette Coleman\\'s legendary—and controversial—1960 appearances at New York City\\'s Five Spot jazz club. He initially expressed rather mixed feelings for Coleman\\'s innovative music: \"...if the free-form guys could play the same tune twice, then I would say they were playing something...Most of the time they use their fingers on the saxophone and they don\\'t even know what\\'s going to come out. They\\'re experimenting.\" That same year, however, Mingus formed a quartet with Richmond, trumpeter Ted Curson and multi-instrumentalist Eric Dolphy. This ensemble featured the same instruments as Coleman\\'s quartet, and is often regarded as Mingus rising to the challenging new standard established by Coleman. The quartet recorded on both Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus and Mingus.  The former also features the version of \"Fables of Faubus\" with lyrics, aptly titled \"Original Faubus Fables\".\\nOnly one misstep occurred in this era: The Town Hall Concert in October 1962, a \"live workshop\"/recording session. With an ambitious program, the event was plagued with troubles from its inception.[15] Mingus\\'s vision, now known as Epitaph, was finally realized by conductor Gunther Schuller in a concert in 1989, a decade after Mingus died.\\nIn 1963, Mingus released The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, described as \"one of the greatest achievements in orchestration by any composer in jazz history.\"[16] The album was also unique in that Mingus asked his psychotherapist, Dr. Edmund Pollock, to provide notes for the record.\\nMingus also released Mingus Plays Piano, an unaccompanied album featuring some fully improvised pieces, in 1963.\\nIn addition, 1963 saw the release of Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus, an album  praised by critic Nat Hentoff.[17]\\nIn 1964 Mingus put together one of his best-known groups, a sextet including Dannie Richmond, Jaki Byard, Eric Dolphy, trumpeter Johnny Coles, and tenor saxophonist Clifford Jordan. The group was recorded frequently during its short existence; Coles fell ill and left during a European tour. Dolphy stayed in Europe after the tour ended, and died suddenly in Berlin on June 28, 1964. 1964 was also the year that Mingus met his future wife, Sue Graham Ungaro. The couple were married in 1966 by Allen Ginsberg.[18] Facing financial hardship, Mingus was evicted from his New York home in 1966.\\nMingus\\'s pace slowed somewhat in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1974, after his 1970 sextet with Charles McPherson, Eddie Preston and Bobby Jones disbanded, he formed a quintet with Richmond, pianist Don Pullen, trumpeter Jack Walrath and saxophonist George Adams. They recorded two well-received albums, Changes One and Changes Two. Mingus also played with Charles McPherson in many of his groups during this time. Cumbia and Jazz Fusion in 1976 sought to blend Colombian music (the \"Cumbia\" of the title) with more traditional jazz forms. In 1971, Mingus taught for a semester at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York as the Slee Professor of Music.[19]\\nBy the mid-1970s, Mingus was suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). His once formidable bass technique declined until he could no longer play the instrument. He continued composing, however, and supervised a number of recordings before his death. At the time of his death, he was working with Joni Mitchell on an album eventually titled Mingus, which included lyrics added by Mitchell to his compositions, including \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\". The album featured the talents of Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, and another influential bassist and composer, Jaco Pastorius.\\nMingus died, aged 56, in Cuernavaca, Mexico, where he had traveled for treatment and convalescence. His ashes were scattered in the Ganges River.\\nHis compositions retained the hot and soulful feel of hard bop, drawing heavily from black gospel music and blues, while sometimes containing elements of Third Stream, free jazz, and classical music. He once cited Duke Ellington and church as his main influences.\\nMingus espoused collective improvisation, similar to the old New Orleans jazz parades, paying particular attention to how each band member interacted with the group as a whole. In creating his bands, he looked not only at the skills of the available musicians, but also their personalities. Many musicians passed through his bands and later went on to impressive careers. He recruited talented and sometimes little-known artists, whom he utilized to assemble unconventional instrumental configurations. As a performer, Mingus was a pioneer in double bass technique, widely recognized as one of the instrument\\'s most proficient players.\\nBecause of his brilliant writing for midsize ensembles, and his catering to and emphasizing the strengths of the musicians in his groups, Mingus is often considered the heir of Duke Ellington, for whom he expressed great admiration and collaborated on the record Money Jungle. Indeed, Dizzy Gillespie had once claimed Mingus reminded him \"of a young Duke\", citing their shared \"organizational genius.\"[20]\\nNearly as well known as his ambitious music was Mingus\\'s often fearsome temperament, which earned him the nickname \"The Angry Man of Jazz\". His refusal to compromise his musical integrity led to many onstage eruptions, exhortations to musicians, and dismissals.[21] Although respected for his musical talents, Mingus was sometimes feared for his occasionally violent onstage temper, which was at times directed at members of his band and other times aimed at the audience.[22] He was physically large, prone to obesity (especially in his later years), and was by all accounts often intimidating and frightening when expressing anger or displeasure. When confronted with a nightclub audience talking and clinking ice in their glasses while he performed, Mingus stopped his band and loudly chastised the audience, stating: \"Isaac Stern doesn\\'t have to put up with this shit.\"[23] Mingus reportedly destroyed a $20,000 bass in response to audience heckling at the Five Spot in New York City.[24]\\nGuitarist and singer Jackie Paris was a first-hand witness to Mingus\\'s irascibility. Paris recalls his time in the Jazz Workshop: \"He chased everybody off the stand except [drummer] Paul Motian and me... The three of us just wailed on the blues for about an hour and a half before he called the other cats back.\"[25]\\nOn October 12, 1962, Mingus punched Jimmy Knepper in the mouth while the two men were working together at Mingus\\' apartment on a score for his upcoming concert at The Town Hall in New York, and Knepper refused to take on more work. Mingus\\' blow broke off a crowned tooth and its underlying stub.[26] According to Knepper, this ruined his embouchure and resulted in the permanent loss of the top octave of his range on the trombone – a significant handicap for any professional trombonist. This attack temporarily ended their working relationship, and Knepper was unable to perform at the concert. Charged with assault, Mingus appeared in court in January 1963 and was given a suspended sentence. Knepper did again work with Mingus in 1977 and played extensively with the Mingus Dynasty, formed after Mingus\\' death in 1979.[27]\\nIn addition to bouts of ill temper, Mingus was prone to clinical depression and tended to have brief periods of extreme creative activity intermixed with fairly long stretches of greatly decreased output, such as the five-year period following the death of Eric Dolphy.[28]\\nIn 1966, Mingus was evicted from his apartment at 5 Great Jones Street in New York City for nonpayment of rent, captured in the 1968 documentary film Mingus: Charlie Mingus 1968, directed by Thomas Reichman. The film also features Mingus performing in clubs and in the apartment, firing a .410 shotgun indoors, composing at the piano, playing with and taking care of his young daughter Caroline, and discussing love, art, politics, and the music school he had hoped to create.[29]\\nCharles Mingus\\' music is currently being performed and reinterpreted by the Mingus Big Band, which in October 2008 began playing every Monday at Jazz Standard in New York City, and often tours the rest of the U.S. and Europe. The Mingus Big Band, the Mingus Orchestra, and the Mingus Dynasty band are managed by Jazz Workshop, Inc. and run by Mingus\\' widow Sue Graham Mingus.\\nElvis Costello has written lyrics for a few Mingus pieces. He had once sung lyrics for one piece, \"Invisible Lady\", backed by the Mingus Big Band on the album, Tonight at Noon: Three of Four Shades of Love.[30]\\nEpitaph is considered one of Charles Mingus\\' masterpieces. The composition is 4,235 measures long, requires two hours to perform, and is one of the longest jazz pieces ever written. Epitaph was only completely discovered, by musicologist Andrew Homzy, during the cataloging process after Mingus\\' death. With the help of a grant from the Ford Foundation, the score and instrumental parts were copied, and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra, conducted by Gunther Schuller. This concert was produced by Mingus\\' widow, Sue Graham Mingus, at Alice Tully Hall on June 3, 1989, 10 years after Mingus\\' death. It was performed again at several concerts in 2007. The performance at Walt Disney Concert Hall is available on NPR. Hal Leonard published the complete score in 2008.[citation needed]\\nMingus wrote the sprawling, exaggerated, quasi-autobiography, Beneath the Underdog: His World as Composed by Mingus,[7] throughout the 1960s, and it was published in 1971. Its \"stream of consciousness\" style covered several aspects of his life that had previously been off-record. In addition to his musical and intellectual proliferation, Mingus goes into great detail about his perhaps overstated sexual exploits. He claims to have had more than 31 affairs in the course of his life (including 26 prostitutes in one sitting). This does not include any of his five wives (he claims to have been married to two of them simultaneously). In addition, he asserts that he held a brief career as a pimp. This has never been confirmed.\\nMingus\\'s autobiography also serves as an insight into his psyche, as well as his attitudes about race and society.[31] It includes accounts of abuse at the hands of his father from an early age, being bullied as a child, his removal from a white musician\\'s union, and grappling with disapproval while married to white women and other examples of the hardship and prejudice.[32]\\nThe work of Charles Mingus has also received attention in academia. According to Ashon Crawley, the musicianship of Charles Mingus provides a salient example of the power of music to unsettle the dualistic, categorical distinction of sacred from profane through otherwise epistemologies.[33] Crawley offers a reading of Mingus that examines the deep imbrication uniting Holiness-Pentecostal aesthetic practices and jazz. Mingus recognized the importance and impact of the midweek gathering of black folks at the Holiness-Pentecostal Church at 79th and Watts in Los Angeles that he would attend with his stepmother or his friend Britt Woodman. Crawley goes on to argue that these visits were the impetus for the song \"Wednesday Prayer Meeting.\" Emphasis is placed on the ethical demand of the prayer meeting felt and experienced that, according to Crawley, Mingus attempts to capture. In many ways, \"Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting\" was Mingus\\'s homage, to black sociality. By exploring Mingus\\' homage to black Pentecostal aesthetics, Crawley expounds on how Mingus figured out that those Holiness-Pentecostal gatherings were the constant repetition of the ongoing, deep, intense mode of study, a kind of study wherein the aesthetic forms created could not be severed from the intellectual practice because they were one and also, but not, the same.\" Gunther Schuller has suggested that Mingus should be ranked among the most important American composers, jazz or otherwise. In 1988, a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts[34] made possible the cataloging of Mingus compositions, which were then donated to the Music Division of the New York Public Library[35] for public use. In 1993, The Library of Congress acquired Mingus\\'s collected papers—including scores, sound recordings, correspondence and photos—in what they described as \"the most important acquisition of a manuscript collection relating to jazz in the Library\\'s history\".[36]\\nConsidering the number of compositions that Charles Mingus wrote, his works have not been recorded as often as comparable jazz composers. The only Mingus tribute albums recorded during his lifetime were baritone saxophonist Pepper Adams\\'s album, Pepper Adams Plays the Compositions of Charlie Mingus, in 1963, and Joni Mitchell\\'s album Mingus, in 1979. Of all his works, his elegy for Lester Young, \"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\" (from Mingus Ah Um) has probably had the most recordings.[citation needed][weasel\\xa0words]The song has been covered by both jazz and non-jazz artists, such as Jeff Beck, Andy Summers, Eugene Chadbourne, and Bert Jansch and John Renbourn with and without Pentangle. Joni Mitchell sang a version with lyrics that she wrote for it.\\nElvis Costello has recorded \"Hora Decubitus\" (from Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus) on My Flame Burns Blue (2006). \"Better Git It in Your Soul\" was covered by Davey Graham on his album \"Folk, Blues, and Beyond.\" Trumpeter Ron Miles performs a version of \"Pithecanthropus Erectus\" on his CD \"Witness.\" New York Ska Jazz Ensemble has done a cover of Mingus\\'s \"Haitian Fight Song\", as have the British folk rock group Pentangle and others. Hal Willner\\'s 1992 tribute album Weird Nightmare: Meditations on Mingus (Columbia Records) contains idiosyncratic renditions of Mingus\\'s works involving numerous popular musicians including Chuck D, Keith Richards, Henry Rollins and Dr. John. The Italian band Quintorigo recorded an entire album devoted to Mingus\\'s music, titled Play Mingus.\\nGunther Schuller\\'s edition of Mingus\\'s \"Epitaph\" which premiered at Lincoln Center in 1989 was subsequently released on Columbia/Sony Records.\\nOne of the most elaborate tributes to Mingus came on September 29, 1969, at a festival honoring him. Duke Ellington performed The Clown, with Ellington reading Jean Shepherd\\'s narration. It was long believed that no recording of this performance existed; however, one was discovered and premiered on July 11, 2013, by Dry River Jazz host Trevor Hodgkins for NPR member station KRWG-FM with re-airings on July 13, 2013, and July 26, 2014.[37] Mingus\\'s elegy for Duke, \"Duke Ellington\\'s Sound Of Love\", was recorded by Kevin Mahogany on Double Rainbow (1993) and Anita Wardell on Why Do You Cry? (1995).\\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Charles Mingus among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[38]\\n', 'Benny_Goodman': '\\nBenjamin David Goodman (May 30, 1909 – June 13, 1986) was an American jazz clarinetist and bandleader known as the \"King of Swing\".[1]\\nIn the mid-1930s, Goodman led one of the most popular musical groups in the United States. His concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City on January 16, 1938, is described by critic Bruce Eder as \"the single most important jazz or popular music concert in history: jazz\\'s \\'coming out\\' party to the world of \\'respectable\\' music.\"[2]\\nGoodman\\'s bands started the careers of many jazz musicians. During an era of racial segregation, he led one of the first integrated jazz groups. He performed nearly to the end of his life while exploring an interest in classical music.\\nGoodman, in a 1975 interview[3]\\nGoodman was the ninth of twelve children born to poor Jewish emigrants from the Russian Empire. His father, David Goodman (1873–1926), came to the United States in 1892 from Warsaw in partitioned Poland and became a tailor.[1] His mother, Dora Grisinsky,[1] (1873–1964), came from Kovno. They met in Baltimore, Maryland, and moved to Chicago before Goodman\\'s birth. With little income and a large family, they moved to the Maxwell Street neighborhood, an overcrowded slum near railroad yards and factories that was populated by German, Irish, Italian, Polish, Scandinavian, and Jewish immigrants.[3]\\nMoney was a constant problem. On Sundays, his father took the children to free band concerts in Douglass Park, which was the first time Goodman experienced live professional performances. To give his children some skills and an appreciation for music, his father enrolled ten-year-old Goodman and two of his brothers in music lessons, from 1919, at the Kehelah Jacob Synagogue[4] and Benny received two years of instruction from the classically trained clarinetist and Chicago Symphony member, Franz Schoepp.[5][6][7] During the next year Goodman joined the boys club band at Hull House, where he received lessons from director James Sylvester. By joining the band, he was entitled to spend two weeks at a summer camp near Chicago. It was the only time he could get away from his bleak neighborhood.[3] At 13, he got his first union card.[8] He performed on Lake Michigan excursion boats, and in 1923 played at Guyon\\'s Paradise, a local dance hall.[9]\\nIn summer 1923, he met Bix Beiderbecke.[5] He attended the Lewis Institute (Illinois Institute of Technology) in 1924 as a high-school sophomore and played clarinet in a dance hall band.\\nWhen he was 17, his father was killed by a passing car after stepping off a streetcar.[10] His father\\'s death was \"the saddest thing that ever happened in our family\", Goodman said.[3]:42\\nHis early influences were New Orleans jazz clarinetists who worked in Chicago, such as Jimmie Noone,[11] Johnny Dodds, and Leon Roppolo. He learned quickly, becoming a strong player at an early age, and was soon playing in bands. He made his professional debut in 1921 at the Central Park Theater on the West Side of Chicago. He entered Harrison Technical High School in Chicago in 1922. At fourteen he became a member of the musicians\\' union and worked in a band featuring Bix Beiderbecke.[12] Two years later he joined the Ben Pollack Orchestra and made his first recordings in 1926.[11]\\nGoodman moved to New York City and became a session musician for radio, Broadway musicals, and in studios.[13] In addition to clarinet, he sometimes played alto saxophone and baritone saxophone.[11] In a Victor recording session on March 21, 1928, he played alongside Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Joe Venuti in the All-Star Orchestra directed by Nathaniel Shilkret.[14][15][16] He played with the bands of  Red Nichols, Ben Selvin, Ted Lewis, and Isham Jones and recorded for Brunswick under the name Benny Goodman\\'s Boys, a band that featured Glenn Miller. In 1928, Goodman and Miller wrote \"Room 1411\", which was released as a Brunswick 78.[17]\\nHe reached the charts for the first time when he recorded \"He\\'s Not Worth Your Tears\" with a vocal by Scrappy Lambert for Melotone. After signing with Columbia in 1934, he had top ten hits with \"Ain\\'t Cha Glad?\" and \"I Ain\\'t Lazy, I\\'m Just Dreamin\\'\" sung by Jack Teagarden, \"Ol\\' Pappy\" sung by Mildred Bailey, and \"Riffin\\' the Scotch\" sung by Billie Holiday. An invitation to play at the Billy Rose Music Hall led to his creation of an orchestra for the four-month engagement. The orchestra recorded \"Moonglow\", which became a number one hit and was followed by the Top Ten hits \"Take My Word\" and \"Bugle Call Rag\".[13]\\nNBC hired Goodman for the radio program Let\\'s Dance.[13] John Hammond asked Fletcher Henderson if he wanted to write arrangements for Goodman, and Henderson agreed.[3]:114 During the Depression, Henderson disbanded his orchestra because he was in debt.[18] Goodman hired Henderson\\'s band members to teach his musicians how to play the music.[19]\\nGoodman\\'s band was one of three to perform on Let\\'s Dance, playing arrangements by Henderson along with hits such as \"Get Happy\" and \"Limehouse Blues\" by Spud Murphy.[20]\\nGoodman\\'s portion of the program was broadcast too late at night to attract a large audience on the east coast. He and his band remained on Let\\'s Dance until May of that year when a strike by employees of the series\\' sponsor, Nabisco, forced the cancellation of the radio show. An engagement was booked at Manhattan\\'s Roosevelt Grill filling in for Guy Lombardo, but the audience expected \"sweet\" music and Goodman\\'s band was unsuccessful.[21]\\nGoodman spent six months performing on Let\\'s Dance, and during that time he recorded six more Top Ten hits for Columbia.[13]\\nOn July 31, 1935, \"King Porter Stomp\" was released with \"Sometimes I\\'m Happy\" on the B-side, both arranged by Henderson and recorded on July 1.[3]:134 In Pittsburgh at the Stanley Theater some members of the audience danced in the aisles.[22] But these arrangements had little impact on the tour until August 19 at McFadden\\'s Ballroom in Oakland, California.[23] Goodman and his band, which included Bunny Berrigan, drummer Gene Krupa, and singer  Helen Ward were met by a large crowd of young dancers who cheered the music they had heard on Let\\'s Dance.[24] Herb Caen wrote, \"from the first note, the place was in an uproar.\"[25] One night later, at Pismo Beach, the show was a flop, and the band thought the overwhelming reception in Oakland had been a fluke.[21] [a]\\nThe next night, August 21, 1935, at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles, Goodman and his band began a three-week engagement. On top of the Let\\'s Dance airplay, Al Jarvis had been playing Goodman\\'s records on KFWB radio.[26] Goodman started the evening with stock arrangements, but after an indifferent response, he began the second set with arrangements by Fletcher Henderson and Spud Murphy. According to Willard Alexander, the band\\'s booking agent, Krupa said, \"If we\\'re gonna die, Benny, let\\'s die playing our own thing.\"[27] The crowd broke into cheers and applause. News reports spread word of the exciting music and enthusiastic dancing.[21] The Palomar engagement was such a marked success that it is often described as the beginning of the swing era.[21] According to Donald Clarke, \"It is clear in retrospect that the Swing Era  had been waiting to happen, but it was Goodman and his band that touched it off.\"[21]\\nThe reception of American swing was less enthusiastic in Europe. British author J. C. Squire filed a complaint with BBC radio to demand it stop playing Goodman\\'s music, which he called \"an awful series of jungle noises which can hearten no man.\"[3]:243 Germany\\'s Nazi party barred jazz from the radio, claiming it was part of a Jewish conspiracy to destroy the culture. Italy\\'s fascist government banned the broadcast of any music composed or played by Jews which they said threatened \"the flower of our race, the youth.\"[3]:244\\nIn November 1935 Goodman accepted an invitation to play in Chicago at the Joseph Urban Room at the Congress Hotel. His stay there extended to six months, and his popularity was cemented by nationwide radio broadcasts over NBC affiliate stations. While in Chicago, the band recorded If I Could Be with You, Stompin\\' at the Savoy, and Goody, Goody.[21] Goodman also played three concerts produced by Chicago socialite and jazz aficionado Helen Oakley. These \"Rhythm Club\" concerts at the Congress Hotel included sets in which Goodman and Krupa sat in with Fletcher Henderson\\'s band, perhaps the first racially integrated big band appearing before a paying audience in the United States.[21] Goodman and Krupa played in a trio with Teddy Wilson on piano. Both combinations were well received, and Wilson remained.\\nIn his 1935–1936 radio broadcasts from Chicago, Goodman was introduced as the \"Rajah of Rhythm.\"[27] Slingerland Drum Company had been calling Krupa the \"King of Swing\" as part of a sales campaign, but shortly after Goodman and his crew left Chicago in May 1936 to spend the summer filming The Big Broadcast of 1937 in Hollywood, the title \"King of Swing\" was applied to Goodman by the media.[21]\\nAt the end of June 1936, Goodman went to Hollywood, where, on June 30, 1936, his band began CBS\\'s Camel Caravan, its third and (according to Connor and Hicks) its greatest sponsored radio show, co-starring Goodman and his former boss Nathaniel Shilkret.[14][15] By spring 1936, Fletcher Henderson was writing arrangements for Goodman\\'s band.[12]\\nIn late 1937, Goodman\\'s publicist Wynn Nathanson suggested that Goodman and his band play Carnegie Hall in New York City. The sold-out concert was held on the evening of January 16, 1938. It is regarded as one of the most significant in jazz history. After years of work by musicians from all over the country, jazz had finally been accepted by mainstream audiences. Recordings of the concert were made, but even by the technology of the day the equipment used was not of the finest quality. Acetate recordings of the concert were made, and aluminum studio masters were cut.[28] \"The recording was produced by Albert Marx as a special gift for his wife, Helen Ward, and a second set for Benny. He contracted Artists Recording Studio to make two sets. Artists Recording only had two turntables so they farmed out the second set to Raymond Scott\\'s recording studio....It was Benny\\'s sister-in-law who found the recordings in Benny\\'s apartment [in 1950] and brought them to Benny\\'s attention.[3]:366 Goodman took the discovered recording to Columbia, and a selection was issued on LP as The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert.\\nPianist and arranger Mary Lou Williams suggested to Hammond that he see guitarist Charlie Christian.[29] Hammond had seen Christian perform in Oklahoma City in 1939 and recommended him to Goodman, but Goodman was uninterested in electric guitar and was put off by Christian\\'s taste in gaudy clothing. During a break at a concert in Beverly Hills, Hammond inserted Christian into the band. Goodman started playing \"Rose Room\" on the assumption that Christian didn\\'t know it, but his performance impressed everyone.[30] Christian was a member of the Benny Goodman Sextet from 1939 to 1941, and during these two years he turned the electric guitar into a popular jazz instrument.[31]\\nGoodman continued his success throughout the late 1930s with his big band, his trio and quartet, and the sextet formed in August 1939, the same month Goodman returned to Columbia Records after four years with RCA Victor. At Columbia, John Hammond, his future brother-in-law, produced most of his sessions. By the mid-1940s, however, big bands had lost much of their popularity. In 1941, ASCAP had a licensing war with music publishers. From 1942 to 1944 and again in 1948, the musicians\\' union went on strike against the major record labels in the United States, and singers acquired the popularity that the big bands had once enjoyed. During the 1942–44 strike, the War Department approached the union and requested the production of V-Discs, a set of records containing new recordings for soldiers to listen to, thereby boosting the rise of new artists[32] Also, by the late 1940s, swing was no longer the dominant style of jazz musicians.[33]\\nBy the 1940s, some jazz musicians were borrowing from classical music, while others, such as Charlie Parker, were broadening the rhythmic, harmonic, and melodic vocabulary of swing to create bebop (or bop). The bebop recordings Goodman made for Capitol were praised by critics. For his bebop band he hired Buddy Greco, Zoot Sims, and Wardell Gray.[34] He consulted his friend Mary Lou Williams for advice on how to approach the music of Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. Pianist Mel Powell was also an adviser in 1945.[34] Goodman enjoyed bebop. When he heard Thelonious Monk, he said, \"I like it, I like that very much. I like the piece and I like the way he played it\\xa0... I think he\\'s got a sense of humor and he\\'s got some good things there.\"[34] He also admired Swedish clarinetist Stan Hasselgard. But after playing with a bebop band for over a year, he returned to his swing band because he concluded that was what he knew best.[35] In 1953, he said, \"Maybe bop has done more to set music back for years than anything\\xa0... Basically it\\'s all wrong. It\\'s not even knowing the scales\\xa0... Bop was mostly publicity and people figuring angles.\"[3]:354\\nIn 1949 he studied with clarinetist Reginald Kell, requiring a change in technique: \"instead of holding the mouthpiece between his front teeth and lower lip, as he had done since he first took a clarinet in hand 30 years earlier, Goodman learned to adjust his embouchure to the use of both lips and even to use new fingering techniques. He had his old finger calluses removed and started to learn how to play his clarinet again—almost from scratch.\"[36]\\nGoodman commissioned compositions for clarinet and chamber ensembles or orchestra that have become standard pieces of classical repertoire. He premiered works by composers, such as Contrasts by Béla Bartók; Clarinet Concerto No. 2, Op. 115 by Malcolm Arnold; Derivations for Clarinet and Band by Morton Gould; Sonata for Clarinet and Piano by Francis Poulenc, and Clarinet Concerto by Aaron Copland. Prelude, Fugue, and Riffs by Leonard Bernstein was commissioned for Woody Herman\\'s big band, but it was premiered by Goodman. Herman was the dedicatee (1945) and first performer (1946) of Igor Stravinsky\\'s Ebony Concerto, but many years later Stravinsky made another recording with Goodman as the soloist.[37]\\nHe made a recording of Mozart\\'s Clarinet Quintet in July 1956 with the Boston Symphony String Quartet at the Berkshire Festival; on the same occasion he recorded Mozart\\'s Clarinet Concerto in A major, K. 622, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Charles Munch. He also recorded the clarinet concertos of Weber[3]:324\\nAfter forays outside swing, Goodman started a new band in 1953. According to Donald Clarke, this was not a happy time for Goodman. He reunited the band to tour with Louis Armstrong. But he insulted Armstrong and \"was appalled at the vaudeville aspects of Louis\\'s act...a contradiction of everything Goodman stood for\".[21] Armstrong left Goodman hanging during a joint performance where Goodman called Armstrong back onstage to wrap up the show. Armstrong refused to perform alongside Goodman, which led essentially to the end of their friendship.\\nGoodman\\'s band appeared as a specialty act in the films The Big Broadcast of 1937; Hollywood Hotel (1938); Syncopation (1942); The Powers Girl (1942); Stage Door Canteen (1943); The Gang\\'s All Here (1943); Sweet and Low-Down (1944), Goodman\\'s only starring feature; Make Mine Music (1946)[38] and A Song Is Born (1948).\\nHe continued to play on records and in small groups. In the early 1970s he collaborated with George Benson after the two met taping a PBS tribute to John Hammond, recreating some of Goodman\\'s  duets with Charlie Christian.[3]:434 Benson appeared on Goodman\\'s album Seven Come Eleven. Goodman continued to play swing, but he practiced and performed classical pieces and commissioned them for clarinet. In 1960 he performed Mozart\\'s Clarinet Concerto with conductor Alfredo Antonini at the Lewisohn Stadium in New York City.[39][40]  Despite health problems, he continued to perform, his last concert six days before his death. Goodman died June 13, 1986, from a heart attack while taking a nap at his apartment in Manhattan House.[41]\\nOne of Goodman\\'s closest friends was Columbia producer John Hammond, who influenced Goodman\\'s move from Victor to Columbia.[3]:259 Goodman married Hammond\\'s sister, Alice Frances Hammond Duckworth (1913–1978), on March 20, 1942.[42] They had two daughters and raised Alice\\'s three daughters from her first marriage[41] to British politician Arthur Duckworth. Goodman\\'s daughter Rachel became a classical pianist.[43] She sometimes performed in concert with him, beginning when she was sixteen.[44]\\nGoodman and Hammond had disagreements from the 1930s onwards. For the 1939 Spirituals to Swing concert Hammond had placed Charlie Christian into the Kansas City Six to play before Goodman\\'s band, which had angered Goodman. They disagreed over the band\\'s music until Goodman refused to listen to Hammond. Their arguments escalated, and in 1941 Hammond left Columbia.[3]:311 Goodman appeared on a 1975 PBS tribute to Hammond but remained at a distance. In the 1980s, after the death of Alice Goodman, Hammond and Goodman reconciled. On June 25, 1985, Goodman appeared at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City for \"A Tribute to John Hammond\".[45]\\nGoodman was regarded by some as a demanding taskmaster, by others as an arrogant and eccentric martinet. Many musicians spoke of \"The Ray\",[3]:173 the glare that Goodman directed at a musician who failed to perform to his standards. After guitarist Allan Reuss incurred Goodman\\'s displeasure, Goodman relegated him to the rear of the bandstand where his contribution would be drowned out by the other musicians. Vocalists Anita O\\'Day and Helen Forrest spoke bitterly of their experiences singing with Goodman: \"The twenty or so months I spent with Benny felt like twenty years,\" said Forrest. \"When I look back, they seem like a life sentence.\" He was generous and funded several college educations, though always secretly. When a friend asked him why, he said, \"Well, if they knew about it, everyone would come to me with their hand out.\"[3]:296, 301, 302, 401\\n—Lionel Hampton on Benny Goodman[3]:183–184\\nGoodman helped racial integration in America. In the early 1930s, black and white musicians could not play together in most clubs and concerts. In the Southern states, racial segregation was enforced by Jim Crow laws. Goodman hired Teddy Wilson for his trio and added vibraphonist Lionel Hampton for his quartet. In 1939 he hired guitarist Charlie Christian.[citation needed] This integration in music happened ten years before Jackie Robinson broke Major League Baseball\\'s six-decade-long color line. According to Jazz (Episode 5) by Ken Burns, Lionel Hampton states that when someone asked Goodman why he \"played with that nigger\" (referring to Teddy Wilson), Goodman replied, \"I\\'ll knock you out if you use that word around me again\".[This quote needs a citation]\\nIn 1962, the Benny Goodman Orchestra toured the Soviet Union as part of a cultural exchange program between the two nations after the Cuban Missile Crisis and the end of that phase of the Cold War; both visits were part of efforts to normalize relations between the United States and the USSR.[46] Members of the band included Jimmy Knepper, Jerry Dodgion, and Turk Van Lake (Vanig Hovsepian).[47] Bassist Bill Crow published a very jaundiced view of the tour and Goodman\\'s conduct during it under the title \"To Russia Without Love\".[48]\\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Benny Goodman among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[49]\\nGoodman was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[50]\\nAfter winning polls as best jazz clarinetist, Goodman was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1957.\\nHe was a member of the radio division of the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame.[51]\\nHis papers were donated to Yale University after his death.[6] He received honorary doctorates from Union College, the University of Illinois, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville,[52] Bard College,  Brandeis University, Columbia University, Harvard University, and Yale University.[12]\\nHis music appeared in the documentary Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story (2010) narrated by actor Dustin Hoffman.[53][54]\\n\\n', 'Count_Basie': '\\nWilliam James \"Count\" Basie (/ˈbeɪsi/; August 21, 1904\\xa0– April 26, 1984)[1] was an American jazz pianist, organist, bandleader, and composer. In 1935, Basie formed his own jazz orchestra, the Count Basie Orchestra, and in 1936 took them to Chicago for a long engagement and their first recording. He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two \"split\" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, riffing with a big band, using arrangers to broaden their sound, and others. Many musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans, the guitarist Freddie Green, trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry \"Sweets\" Edison, plunger trombonist Al Grey, and singers Jimmy Rushing, Helen Humes, Thelma Carpenter, and Joe Williams.\\nWilliam Basie was born to Lillian and Harvey Lee Basie in Red Bank, New Jersey.[2][3] His father worked as a coachman and caretaker for a wealthy judge. After automobiles replaced horses, his father became a groundskeeper and handyman for several wealthy families in the area.[4] Both of his parents had some type of musical background. His father played the mellophone, and his mother played the piano; in fact, she gave Basie his first piano lessons. She took in laundry and baked cakes for sale for a living. She paid 25 cents a lesson for Count Basie\\'s piano instruction.[5][6]\\nThe best student in school, Basie dreamed of a traveling life, inspired by touring carnivals which came to town. He finished junior high school[7] but spent much of his time at the Palace Theater in Red Bank, where doing occasional chores gained him free admission to performances. He quickly learned to improvise music appropriate to the acts and the silent movies.[8]\\nThough a natural at the piano, Basie preferred drums. Discouraged by the obvious talents of Sonny Greer, who also lived in Red Bank and became Duke Ellington\\'s drummer in 1919, Basie switched to piano exclusively at age 15.[5] Greer and Basie played together in venues until Greer set out on his professional career. By then, Basie was playing with pick-up groups for dances, resorts, and amateur shows, including Harry Richardson\\'s \"Kings of Syncopation\".[9] When not playing a gig, he hung out at the local pool hall with other musicians, where he picked up on upcoming play dates and gossip. He got some jobs in Asbury Park at the Jersey Shore, and played at the Hong Kong Inn until a better player took his place.[10]\\nAround 1920, Basie went to Harlem, a hotbed of jazz, where he lived down the block from the Alhambra Theater. Early after his arrival, he bumped into Sonny Greer, who was by then the drummer for the Washingtonians, Duke Ellington\\'s early band.[11] Soon, Basie met many of the Harlem musicians who were \"making the scene,\" including Willie \"the Lion\" Smith and James P. Johnson.\\nBasie toured in several acts between 1925 and 1927, including Katie Krippen and Her Kiddies (featuring singer Katie Crippen) as part of the Hippity Hop show; on the Keith, the Columbia Burlesque, and the Theater Owners Bookers Association (T.O.B.A.) vaudeville circuits; and as a soloist and accompanist to blues singer Gonzelle White as well as Crippen.[12][13] His touring took him to Kansas City, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Chicago. Throughout his tours, Basie met many jazz musicians, including Louis Armstrong.[14] Before he was 20 years old, he toured extensively on the Keith and TOBA vaudeville circuits as a solo pianist, accompanist, and music director for blues singers, dancers, and comedians. This provided an early training that was to prove significant in his later career.[15]\\nBack in Harlem in 1925, Basie gained his first steady job at Leroy\\'s, a place known for its piano players and its \"cutting contests.\" The place catered to \"uptown celebrities,\" and typically the band winged every number without sheet music using \"head arrangements.\"[16] He met Fats Waller, who was playing organ at the Lincoln Theater accompanying silent movies, and Waller taught him how to play that instrument. (Basie later played organ at the Eblon Theater in Kansas City).[1] As he did with Duke Ellington, Willie \"the Lion\" Smith helped Basie out during the lean times by arranging gigs at \"house-rent parties,\" introducing him to other leading musicians, and teaching him some piano technique.[17]\\nIn 1928, Basie was in Tulsa and heard Walter Page and his Famous Blue Devils, one of the first big bands, which featured Jimmy Rushing on vocals.[18] A few months later, he was invited to join the band, which played mostly in Texas and Oklahoma. It was at this time that he began to be known as \"Count\" Basie (see Jazz royalty).[19]\\nThe following year, in 1929, Basie became the pianist with the Bennie Moten band based in Kansas City, inspired by Moten\\'s ambition to raise his band to the level of Duke Ellington\\'s or Fletcher Henderson\\'s.[20] Where the Blue Devils were \"snappier\" and more \"bluesy,\" the Moten band was more refined and respected, playing in the \"Kansas City stomp\" style.[21] In addition to playing piano, Basie was co-arranger with Eddie Durham, who notated the music.[22]\\nTheir \"Moten Swing\", which Basie claimed credit for,[23] was widely acclaimed and was an invaluable contribution to the development of swing music, and at one performance at the Pearl Theatre in Philadelphia in December 1932, the theatre opened its door to allow anybody in who wanted to hear the band perform.[24] \\nDuring a stay in Chicago, Basie recorded with the band. He occasionally played four-hand piano and dual pianos with Moten, who also conducted.[25] The band improved with several personnel changes, including the addition of tenor saxophonist Ben Webster.\\nWhen the band voted Moten out, Basie took over for several months, calling the group \"Count Basie and his Cherry Blossoms. \"When his own band folded, he rejoined Moten with a newly re-organized band.[26] A year later, Basie joined Bennie Moten\\'s band, and played with them until Moten\\'s death in 1935 from a failed tonsillectomy. When Moten died, the band tried to stay together but couldn\\'t make a go of it. Basie then formed his own nine-piece band, Barons of Rhythm, with many former Moten members including Walter Page (bass), Freddie Green (guitar), Jo Jones (drums), Lester Young (tenor saxophone) and Jimmy Rushing (vocals).\\nThe Barons of Rhythm were regulars at the Reno Club and often performed for a live radio broadcast. During a broadcast the announcer wanted to give Basie\\'s name some style, so he called him \"Count.\" Little did Basie know this touch of royalty would give him proper status and position him with the likes of Duke Ellington and Earl Hines.\\nBasie\\'s new band which included many Moten alumni, with the important addition of tenor player Lester Young. They played at the Reno Club and sometimes were broadcast on local radio. Late one night with time to fill, the band started improvising. Basie liked the results and named the piece \"One O\\'Clock Jump.\"[27] According to Basie, \"we hit it with the rhythm section and went into the riffs, and the riffs just stuck. We set the thing up front in D-flat, and then we just went on playing in F.\" It became his signature tune.[28]\\nAt the end of 1936, Basie and his band, now billed as \"Count Basie and His Barons of Rhythm,\" moved from Kansas City to Chicago, where they honed their repertoire at a long engagement at the Grand Terrace Ballroom.[29] Right from the start, Basie\\'s band was noted for its rhythm section. Another Basie innovation was the use of two tenor saxophone players; at the time, most bands had just one. When Young complained of Herschel Evans\\' vibrato, Basie placed them on either side of the alto players, and soon had the tenor players engaged in \"duels\". Many other bands later adapted the split tenor arrangement.[30]\\nIn that city in October 1936, the band had a recording session which the producer John Hammond later described as \"the only perfect, completely perfect recording session I\\'ve ever had anything to do with\".[31] Hammond had heard Basie\\'s band by radio and went to Kansas City to check them out.[32] He invited them to record, in performances which were Lester Young\\'s earliest recordings. Those four sides were released on Vocalion Records under the band name of Jones-Smith Incorporated; the sides were \"Shoe Shine Boy\", \"Evening\", \"Boogie Woogie\", and \"Lady Be Good\". After Vocalion became a subsidiary of Columbia Records in 1938, \"Boogie Woogie\" was released in 1941 as part of a four-record compilation album entitled Boogie Woogie (Columbia album C44).[33] When he made the Vocalion recordings, Basie had already signed with Decca Records, but did not have his first recording session with them until January 1937.[34]\\nBy then, Basie\\'s sound was characterized by a \"jumping\" beat and the contrapuntal accents of his own piano. His personnel around 1937 included: Lester Young and Herschel Evans (tenor sax), Freddie Green (guitar), Jo Jones (drums), Walter Page (bass), Earle Warren (alto sax), Buck Clayton and Harry Edison (trumpet), Benny Morton and Dickie Wells (trombone).[35] Lester Young, known as \"Prez\" by the band, came up with nicknames for all the other band members. He called Basie \"Holy Man\", \"Holy Main\", and just plain \"Holy\".[36]\\nBasie favored blues, and he would showcase some of the most notable blues singers of the era after he went to New York: Billie Holiday, Jimmy Rushing, Big Joe Turner, Helen Humes, and Joe Williams. He also hired arrangers who knew how to maximize the band\\'s abilities, such as Eddie Durham and Jimmy Mundy.\\nWhen Basie took his orchestra to New York in 1937, they made the Woodside Hotel in Harlem their base (they often rehearsed in its basement).[37] Soon, they were booked at the Roseland Ballroom for the Christmas show. Basie recalled a review, which said something like, \"We caught the great Count Basie band which is supposed to be so hot he was going to come in here and set the Roseland on fire. Well, the Roseland is still standing\".[38] Compared to the reigning band of Fletcher Henderson, Basie\\'s band lacked polish and presentation.[39]\\nThe producer John Hammond continued to advise and encourage the band, and they soon came up with some adjustments, including softer playing, more solos, and more standards. They paced themselves to save their hottest numbers for later in the show, to give the audience a chance to warm up.[40] His first official recordings for Decca followed, under contract to agent MCA, including \"Pennies from Heaven\" and \"Honeysuckle Rose\".[41]\\nHammond introduced Basie to Billie Holiday, whom he invited to sing with the band. (Holiday did not record with Basie, as she had her own record contract and preferred working with small combos).[42] The band\\'s first appearance at the Apollo Theater followed, with the vocalists Holiday and Jimmy Rushing getting the most attention.[43] Durham returned to help with arranging and composing, but for the most part, the orchestra worked out its numbers in rehearsal, with Basie guiding the proceedings. There were often no musical notations made. Once the musicians found what they liked, they usually were able to repeat it using their \"head arrangements\" and collective memory.[44]\\nNext, Basie played at the Savoy, which was noted more for lindy-hopping, while the Roseland was a place for fox-trots and congas.[45] In early 1938, the Savoy was the meeting ground for a \"battle of the bands\" with Chick Webb\\'s group. Basie had Holiday, and Webb countered with the singer Ella Fitzgerald. As Metronome magazine proclaimed, \"Basie\\'s Brilliant Band Conquers Chick\\'s\"; the article described the evening:\\nThroughout the fight, which never let down in its intensity during the whole fray, Chick took the aggressive, with the Count playing along easily and, on the whole, more musically scientifically. Undismayed by Chick\\'s forceful drum beating, which sent the audience into shouts of encouragement and appreciation and casual beads of perspiration to drop from Chick\\'s brow onto the brass cymbals, the Count maintained an attitude of poise and self-assurance. He constantly parried Chick\\'s thundering haymakers with tantalizing runs and arpeggios which teased more and more force from his adversary.[46]The publicity over the big band battle, before and after, gave the Basie band a boost and wider recognition. Soon after, Benny Goodman recorded their signature \"One O\\'Clock Jump\" with his band.[47]\\nA few months later, Holiday left for Artie Shaw\\'s band. Hammond introduced Helen Humes, whom Basie hired; she stayed with Basie for four years.[48] When Eddie Durham left for Glenn Miller\\'s orchestra, he was replaced by Dicky Wells. Basie\\'s 14-man band began playing at the Famous Door, a mid-town nightspot with a CBS network feed and air conditioning, which Hammond was said to have bought the club in return for their booking Basie steadily throughout the summer of 1938. Their fame took a huge leap.[49] Adding to their play book, Basie received arrangements from Jimmy Mundy (who had also worked with Benny Goodman and Earl Hines), particularly for \"Cherokee\", \"Easy Does It\", and \"Super Chief\".[50] In 1939, Basie and his band made a major cross-country tour, including their first West Coast dates. A few months later, Basie quit MCA and signed with the William Morris Agency, who got them better fees.[51]\\nOn February 19, 1940, Count Basie and his Orchestra opened a four-week engagement at Southland in Boston, and they broadcast over the radio on 20 February.[52]\\nOn the West Coast, in 1942 the band did a spot in Reveille With Beverly, a musical film starring Ann Miller, and a \"Command Performance\" for Armed Forces Radio, with Hollywood stars Clark Gable, Bette Davis, Carmen Miranda, Jerry Colonna, and the singer Dinah Shore.[53] Other minor movie spots followed, including Choo Choo Swing, Crazy House, Top Man, Stage Door Canteen, and Hit Parade of 1943.[54] They also continued to record for OKeh Records and Columbia Records.[55] The war years caused a lot of members turn over, and the band worked many play dates with lower pay. Dance hall bookings were down sharply as swing began to fade, the effects of the musicians\\' strikes of 1942–44 and 1948 began to be felt, and the public\\'s taste grew for singers.\\nBasie occasionally lost some key soloists. However, throughout the 1940s, he maintained a big band that possessed an infectious rhythmic beat, an enthusiastic team spirit, and a long list of inspired and talented jazz soloists.[56]\\nCount Basie was the featured artist at the first Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field on September 23, 1945 which was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr.[57]  Al Jarvis was the Emcee and other artists to appear on stage were Joe Liggins and his Honeydrippers, The Peters Sisters, Slim and Bam, Valaida Snow, and Big Joe Turner.[58] They played to a crowd of 15,000. Count Basie and his Orchestra played at the tenth Cavalcade of Jazz concert also at Wrigley Field on June 20, 1954. He played along with The Flairs, Christine Kittrell, Lamp Lighters, Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five, Ruth Brown, and Perez Prado and his Orchestra.[59]\\nThe big band era appeared to have ended after the war, and Basie disbanded the group. For a while, he performed in combos, sometimes stretched to an orchestra. In 1950, he headlined the Universal-International short film \"Sugar Chile\" Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet. He reformed his group as a 16-piece orchestra in 1952. This group was eventually called the New Testament band. Basie credited Billy Eckstine, a top male vocalist of the time, for prompting his return to Big Band. He said that Norman Granz got them into the Birdland club and promoted the new band through recordings on the Mercury, Clef, and Verve labels.[60] The jukebox era had begun, and Basie shared the exposure along with early rock\\'n\\'roll and rhythm and blues artists. Basie\\'s new band was more of an ensemble group, with fewer solo turns, and relying less on \"head\" and more on written arrangements.\\nBasie added touches of bebop \"so long as it made sense\", and he required that \"it all had to have feeling\". Basie\\'s band was sharing Birdland with such bebop greats as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Miles Davis. Behind the occasional bebop solos, he always kept his strict rhythmic pulse, \"so it doesn\\'t matter what they do up front; the audience gets the beat\".[61] Basie also added flute to some numbers, a novelty at the time that became widely copied.[62] Soon, his band was touring and recording again. The new band included: Paul Campbell, Tommy Turrentine, Johnny Letman, Idrees Sulieman, and Joe Newman (trumpet); Jimmy Wilkins, Benny Powell, Matthew Gee (trombone); Paul Quinichette and Floyd \"Candy\" Johnson (tenor sax); Marshal Royal and Ernie Wilkins (alto sax); and Charlie Fowlkes (baritone sax).[63] Down Beat magazine reported, \"(Basie) has managed to assemble an ensemble that can thrill both the listener who remembers 1938 and the youngster who has never before heard a big band like this.\"[64] In 1957, Basie sued the jazz venue Ball and Chain in Miami over outstanding fees, causing the closure of the venue.[65]\\nIn 1958, the band made its first European tour. Jazz was especially appreciated in France, The Netherlands, and Germany in the 1950s; these countries were the stomping grounds for many expatriate American jazz stars who were either resurrecting their careers or sitting out the years of racial divide in the United States. Neal Hefti began to provide arrangements, notably \"Lil Darlin\\'\". By the mid-1950s, Basie\\'s band had become one of the preeminent backing big bands for some of the most prominent jazz vocalists of the time. They also toured with the \"Birdland Stars of 1955\", whose lineup included Sarah Vaughan, Erroll Garner, Lester Young, George Shearing, and Stan Getz.[66]\\nIn 1957, Basie released the live album Count Basie at Newport. \"April in Paris\" (arrangement by Wild Bill Davis) was a best-selling instrumental and the title song for the hit album.[67] The Basie band made two tours in the British Isles and on the second, they put on a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II, along with Judy Garland, Vera Lynn, and Mario Lanza.[68] He was a guest on ABC\\'s The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, a venue also opened to several other black entertainers. In 1959, Basie\\'s band recorded a \"greatest hits\" double album The Count Basie Story (Frank Foster, arranger), and Basie/Eckstine Incorporated, an album featuring Billy Eckstine, Quincy Jones (as arranger) and the Count Basie Orchestra. It was released by Roulette Records, then later reissued by Capitol Records.\\nLater that year, Basie appeared on a television special with Fred Astaire, featuring a dance solo to \"Sweet Georgia Brown\", followed in January 1961 by Basie performing at one of the five John F. Kennedy Inaugural Balls.[69] That summer, Basie and Duke Ellington combined forces for the recording First Time! The Count Meets the Duke, each providing four numbers from their play books.[70]\\nDuring the balance of the 1960s, the band kept busy with tours, recordings, television appearances, festivals, Las Vegas shows, and travel abroad, including cruises. Some time around 1964, Basie adopted his trademark yachting cap.[71]\\nThrough steady changes in personnel, Basie led the band into the 1980s. Basie made a few more movie appearances, such as in the Jerry Lewis film Cinderfella (1960) and the Mel Brooks movie Blazing Saddles (1974), playing a revised arrangement of \"April in Paris\".\\nDuring its heyday, The Gong Show (1976–80) used Basie\\'s \"Jumpin\\' at the Woodside\" during some episodes, while an NBC stagehand named Eugene Patton would dance on stage; Patton became known as \"Gene Gene the Dancing Machine\".\\nBasie was a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity. On July 21, 1930, Basie married Vivian Lee Winn, in Kansas City, Missouri. They were divorced sometime before 1935. Some time in or before 1935, the now single Basie returned to New York City, renting a house at 111 West 138th Street, Manhattan, as evidenced by the 1940 census. He married Catherine Morgan on July 13, 1940 in the King County courthouse in Seattle, Washington. In 1942, they moved to Queens. Their only child, Diane, was born February 6, 1944. She was born with cerebral palsy and the doctors claimed she would never walk. The couple kept her and cared deeply for her, and especially through her mother\\'s tutelage Diane learned not only to walk but to swim.[72] The Basies bought a home in the new whites-only neighborhood of Addisleigh Park in 1946 on Adelaide Road and 175th Street, St. Albans, Queens.[73]\\nOn April 11, 1983, Catherine Basie died of heart disease at the couple\\'s home in Freeport, Grand Bahama Island. She was 67 years old.[74]\\nCount Basie died of pancreatic cancer in Hollywood, Florida on April 26, 1984 at the age of 79.[1]\\nBasie hitched his star to some of the most famous vocalists of the 1950s and 1960s, which helped keep the Big Band sound alive and added greatly to his recording catalog. Jimmy Rushing sang with Basie in the late 1930s. Joe Williams toured with the band and was featured on the 1957 album One O\\'Clock Jump, and 1956\\'s Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings, with \"Every Day (I Have the Blues)\" becoming a huge hit. With Billy Eckstine on the album Basie/Eckstine Incorporated, in 1959. Ella Fitzgerald made some memorable recordings with Basie, including the 1963 album Ella and Basie!. With the New Testament Basie band in full swing, and arrangements written by a youthful Quincy Jones, this album proved a swinging respite from her Songbook recordings and constant touring she did during this period. She even toured with the Basie Orchestra in the mid-1970s, and Fitzgerald and Basie also met on the 1979 albums A Classy Pair, Digital III at Montreux, and A Perfect Match, the last two also recorded live at Montreux. In addition to Quincy Jones, Basie was using arrangers such as Benny Carter (Kansas City Suite), Neal Hefti (The Atomic Mr Basie), and Sammy Nestico (Basie-Straight Ahead).\\nFrank Sinatra recorded for the first time with Basie on 1962\\'s Sinatra-Basie and for a second studio album on 1964\\'s It Might as Well Be Swing, which was arranged by Quincy Jones. Jones also arranged and conducted 1966\\'s live Sinatra at the Sands which featured Sinatra with Count Basie and his orchestra at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. In May 1970, Sinatra performed in London\\'s Royal Festival Hall with the Basie orchestra, in a charity benefit for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. Sinatra later said of this concert \"I have a funny feeling that those two nights could have been my finest hour, really. It went so well; it was so thrilling and exciting\".[75]\\nBasie also recorded with Tony Bennett in the late 1950s. Their albums together included In Person and Strike Up the Band. Basie also toured with Bennett, including a date at Carnegie Hall. Other notable recordings were with Sammy Davis Jr., Bing Crosby, and Sarah Vaughan. One of Basie\\'s biggest regrets was never recording with Louis Armstrong, though they shared the same bill several times.[76] In 1968 Basie and his Band recorded an album with Jackie Wilson titled Manufacturers of Soul.[77][78]\\nCount Basie introduced several generations of listeners to the Big Band sound and left an influential catalog. Basie is remembered by many who worked for him as being considerate of musicians and their opinions, modest, relaxed, fun-loving, dryly witty, and always enthusiastic about his music.[79] In his autobiography, he wrote, \"I think the band can really swing when it swings easy, when it can just play along like you are cutting butter.\"[80]\\nCount Basie made most of his albums with his big band.

Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes and was at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions  and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. Over the course of his career, Coltrane\\'s music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension. He remains one of the most influential saxophonists in music history. He received numerous posthumous awards, including a Pulitzer Prize in 2007, and was canonized by the African Orthodox Church.[2] His second wife was pianist and harpist Alice Coltrane.  The couple had three children: John Jr. (1964–1982), a bassist; Ravi (born 1965), a saxophonist; and Oran (born 1967), also a saxophonist.[3][4][5]\\nColtrane was born in his parents\\' apartment at 200 Hamlet Avenue in Hamlet, North Carolina, on September 23, 1926.[6] His father was John R. Coltrane[7] and his mother was Alice Blair.[8] He grew up in High Point, North Carolina and attended William Penn High School. Beginning in December 1938, his father, aunt, and grandparents died within a few months of each other, leaving him to be raised by his mother and a close cousin.[9] In June 1943, he moved to Philadelphia. In September, his mother bought him his first saxophone, an alto.[8] He played clarinet and alto horn in a community band before beginning alto saxophone in high school. From early to mid-1945 he had his first professional work: a \"cocktail lounge trio\" with piano and guitar.[10]\\nTo avoid being drafted by the Army, Coltrane enlisted in the Navy on August 6, 1945, the day the first U.S. atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.[11] He was trained as an apprentice seaman at Sampson Naval Training Station in upstate New York before he was shipped to Pearl Harbor,[11] where he was stationed at Manana Barracks,[12] the largest posting of African-American servicemen in the world.[13] By the time he got to Hawaii in late 1945, the Navy was downsizing. Coltrane\\'s musical talent was recognized, and he became one of the few Navy men to serve as a musician without having been granted musician\\'s rating when he joined the Melody Masters, the base swing band.[11] As the Melody Masters was an all-white band, however, Coltrane was treated merely as a guest performer to avoid alerting superior officers of his participation in the band.[14] He continued to perform other duties when not playing with the band, including kitchen and security details. By the end of his service, he had assumed a leadership role in the band. His first recordings, an informal session in Hawaii with Navy musicians, occurred on July 13, 1946.[15] He played alto saxophone on a selection of jazz standards and bebop tunes.[16] He was officially discharged from the Navy on August 8, 1946. He was awarded the Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal, American Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal.\\nAfter being discharged from the Navy as a seaman first class in August 1946, Coltrane returned to Philadelphia, where he \"plunged into the heady excitement of the new music and the blossoming bebop scene.\"[17] After touring with King Kolax, he joined a band led by Jimmy Heath, who was introduced to Coltrane\\'s playing by his former Navy buddy, trumpeter William Massey, who had played with Coltrane in the Melody Masters.[18] He studied jazz theory with guitarist and composer Dennis Sandole and continued under Sandole\\'s tutelage through the early 1950s. Although he started on alto saxophone, he began playing tenor saxophone in 1947 with Eddie Vinson.[19]\\nColtrane called this a time when \"a wider area of listening opened up for me. There were many things that people like Hawk [Coleman Hawkins], and Ben [Webster] and Tab Smith were doing in the \\'40s that I didn\\'t understand, but that I felt emotionally.\"[20] A significant influence, according to tenor saxophonist Odean Pope, was the Philadelphia pianist, composer, and theorist Hasaan Ibn Ali. \"Hasaan was the clue to...the system that Trane uses. Hasaan was the great influence on Trane\\'s melodic concept.\"[21] Coltrane became fanatical about practicing and developing his craft, practicing \"25 hours a day\" according to Jimmy Heath. Heath recalls an incident in a hotel in San Francisco when after a complaint was issued, Coltrane took the horn out of his mouth and practiced fingering for a full hour.[22] Such was his dedication it was common for him to fall asleep with the horn still in his mouth or practice a single note for hours on end.[23]\\nAn important moment in the progression of Coltrane\\'s musical development occurred on June 5, 1945, when he saw Charlie Parker perform for the first time. In a DownBeat magazine article in 1960 he recalled, \"the first time I heard Bird play, it hit me right between the eyes.\" Parker became an idol, and they played together occasionally in the late 1940s. He was a member of groups led by Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Bostic, and Johnny Hodges in the early to mid-1950s.\\nIn 1955, Coltrane was freelancing in Philadelphia while studying with guitarist Dennis Sandole when he received a call from trumpeter Miles Davis. Davis had been successful in the 40s, but his reputation and work had been damaged in part by heroin addiction; he was again active and about to form a quintet. Coltrane was with this edition of the Davis band (known as the \"First Great Quintet\"—along with Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums) from October 1955 to April 1957 (with a few absences). During this period Davis released several influential recordings that revealed the first signs of Coltrane\\'s growing ability. This quintet, represented by two marathon recording sessions for Prestige in 1956, resulted in the albums Cookin\\', Relaxin\\', Workin\\', and Steamin\\'. The \"First Great Quintet\" disbanded due in part to Coltrane\\'s heroin addiction.[24]\\nDuring the later part of 1957 Coltrane worked with Thelonious Monk at New York\\'s Five Spot Café, and played in Monk\\'s quartet (July–December 1957), but, owing to contractual conflicts, took part in only one official studio recording session with this group. Coltrane recorded many albums for Prestige under his own name at this time, but Monk refused to record for his old label.[25] A private recording made by Juanita Naima Coltrane of a 1958 reunion of the group was issued by Blue Note Records as Live at the Five Spot—Discovery! in 1993. A high quality tape of a concert given by this quartet in November 1957 was also found later, and was released by Blue Note in 2005. Recorded by Voice of America, the performances confirm the group\\'s reputation, and the resulting album, Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall, is widely acclaimed.\\nBlue Train, Coltrane\\'s sole date as leader for Blue Note, featuring trumpeter Lee Morgan, bassist Paul Chambers, and trombonist Curtis Fuller, is often considered his best album from this period. Four of its five tracks are original Coltrane compositions, and the title track, \"Moment\\'s Notice\", and \"Lazy Bird\", have become standards. Both tunes employed the first examples of his chord substitution cycles known as Coltrane changes.\\nColtrane rejoined Davis in January 1958. In October of that year, jazz critic Ira Gitler coined the term \"sheets of sound\"[26] to describe the style Coltrane developed with Monk and was perfecting in Davis\\'s group, now a sextet. His playing was compressed, with rapid runs cascading in hundreds of notes per minute. Coltrane recalled: \"I found that there were a certain number of chord progressions to play in a given time, and sometimes what I played didn\\'t work out in eighth notes, sixteenth notes, or triplets. I had to put the notes in uneven groups like fives and sevens in order to get them all in.\"[27]\\nColtrane stayed with Davis until April 1960, working with alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley; pianists Red Garland, Bill Evans, and Wynton Kelly; bassist Paul Chambers; and drummers Philly Joe Jones and Jimmy Cobb. During this time he participated in the Davis sessions Milestones and Kind of Blue, and the concert recordings Miles & Monk at Newport (1963) and Jazz at the Plaza (1958).\\nAt the end of this period Coltrane recorded Giant Steps (1959), his first album as leader for Atlantic which contained only his compositions.[28] The album\\'s title track is generally considered to have one of the most difficult chord progressions of any widely played jazz composition.[29] Its altered chord progression cycles came to be known as Coltrane changes.[30] His development of these cycles led to further experimentation with improvised melody and harmony that he continued throughout his career.[31]\\nColtrane formed his first quartet for live performances in 1960 for an appearance at the Jazz Gallery in New York City.[32] After moving through different personnel, including Steve Kuhn, Pete La Roca, and Billy Higgins, he kept pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Steve Davis, and drummer Elvin Jones.[33][34] Tyner, a native of Philadelphia, had been a friend of Coltrane for some years, and the two men had an understanding that Tyner would join the band when he felt ready.[35][36] My Favorite Things (1961) was the first album recorded by this band.[37] It was Coltrane\\'s first album on soprano saxophone,[38] which he began practicing while with Miles Davis.[39] It was considered an unconventional move because the instrument was not as popular in jazz as other types of saxophone.[40]\\nIn May 1961, Coltrane\\'s contract with Atlantic was bought by Impulse!.[41] The move to Impulse! meant that Coltrane resumed his recording relationship with engineer Rudy Van Gelder, who had recorded his and Davis\\'s sessions for Prestige. He recorded most of his albums for Impulse! at Van Gelder\\'s studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.\\nBy early 1961, bassist Davis had been replaced by Reggie Workman, while Eric Dolphy joined the group as a second horn. The quintet had a celebrated and extensively recorded residency at the Village Vanguard, which demonstrated Coltrane\\'s new direction. It included the most experimental music he had played, influenced by Indian ragas, modal jazz, and free jazz. John Gilmore, a longtime saxophonist with musician Sun Ra, was particularly influential; after hearing a Gilmore performance, Coltrane is reported to have said, \"He\\'s got it! Gilmore\\'s got the concept!\"[42] The most celebrated of the Vanguard tunes, the 15-minute blues \"Chasin\\' the \\'Trane\", was strongly inspired by Gilmore\\'s music.[43]\\nStarting in 1961, Coltrane also began pairing Workman with a second bassist, usually Art Davis or Donald Garrett. Garrett recalled playing a tape for Coltrane where \"...I was playing with another bass player. We were doing some things rhythmically, and Coltrane became excited about the sound. We got the same kind of sound you get from the East Indian water drum. One bass remains in the lower register and is the stabilizing, pulsating thing, while the other bass is free to improvise, like the right hand would be on the drum. So Coltrane liked the idea.\"[44] Coltrane also recalled: \"I thought another bass would add that certain rhythmic sound. We were playing a lot of stuff with a sort of suspended rhythm, with one bass playing a series of notes around one point, and it seemed that another bass could fill in the spaces...\"[45] According to Eric Dolphy, one night \"Wilbur Ware came in and up on the stand so they had three basses going. John and I got off the stand and listened...\"[45] Coltrane employed two basses on the 1961 albums Olé Coltrane and Africa/Brass, and later on The John Coltrane Quartet Plays and Ascension.\\nDuring this period, critics were divided in their estimation of Coltrane, who had radically altered his style. Audiences, too, were perplexed; in France he was booed during his final tour with Davis. In 1961, Down Beat magazine called Coltrane and Dolphy players of \"anti-jazz\" in an article that bewildered and upset the musicians.[43] Coltrane admitted some of his early solos were based mostly on technical ideas. Furthermore, Dolphy\\'s angular, voice-like playing earned him a reputation as a figurehead of the \"New Thing\", also known as free jazz, a movement led by Ornette Coleman which was denigrated by some jazz musicians (including Davis) and critics. But as Coltrane\\'s style developed, he was determined to make every performance \"a whole expression of one\\'s being\".[46]\\nIn 1962, Dolphy departed and Jimmy Garrison replaced Workman as bassist. From then on, the \"Classic Quartet\", as it came to be known, with Tyner, Garrison, and Jones, produced searching, spiritually driven work. Coltrane was moving toward a more harmonically static style that allowed him to expand his improvisations rhythmically, melodically, and motivically. Harmonically complex music was still present, but on stage Coltrane heavily favored continually reworking his \"standards\": \"Impressions\", \"My Favorite Things\", and \"I Want to Talk About You\".\\nThe criticism of the quintet with Dolphy may have affected Coltrane. In contrast to the radicalism of his 1961 recordings at the Village Vanguard, his studio albums in the following two years (with the exception of Coltrane, 1962, which featured a blistering version of Harold Arlen\\'s \"Out of This World\") were much more conservative. He recorded an album of ballads and participated in album collaborations with Duke Ellington and singer Johnny Hartman, a baritone who specialized in ballads. The album Ballads (recorded 1961–62) is emblematic of Coltrane\\'s versatility, as the quartet shed new light on old-fashioned standards such as \"It\\'s Easy to Remember\". Despite a more polished approach in the studio, in concert the quartet continued to balance \"standards\" and its own more exploratory and challenging music, as can be heard on the Impressions (recorded 1961–63), Live at Birdland and Newport \\'63 (both recorded 1963). Impressions consists of two extended jams including the title track along with \"Dear Old Stockholm\", \"After the Rain\" and a blues. Coltrane later said he enjoyed having a \"balanced catalogue.\"[47]\\nOn March 6, 1963, the group entered Van Gelder Studio in New Jersey and recorded a session that was lost for decades after its master tape was destroyed by Impulse Records to cut down on storage space. On June 29, 2018, Impulse! released Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album, made up of seven tracks made from a spare copy Coltrane had given to his wife.[48][49] On March 7, 1963, they were joined in the studio by Hartman for the recording of six tracks for the John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman album, released that July.\\nImpulse! followed the successful \"lost album\" release with 2019\\'s Blue World, made up of a 1964 soundtrack to the film The Cat in the Bag, recorded in June 1964.\\nThe Classic Quartet produced their best-selling album, A Love Supreme, in December 1964. A culmination of much of Coltrane\\'s work up to this point, this four-part suite is an ode to his faith in and love for God. These spiritual concerns characterized much of Coltrane\\'s composing and playing from this point onwards—as can be seen from album titles such as Ascension, Om and Meditations. The fourth movement of A Love Supreme, \"Psalm\", is, in fact, a musical setting for an original poem to God written by Coltrane, and printed in the album\\'s liner notes. Coltrane plays almost exactly one note for each syllable of the poem, and bases his phrasing on the words. The album was composed at Coltrane\\'s home in Dix Hills on Long Island.\\nThe quartet played A Love Supreme live only once—in July 1965 at a concert in Antibes, France.[50] A recording of this concert was released by Impulse! in 2002 on the remastered Deluxe Edition of A Love Supreme,[51] and again in 2015 on the \"Super Deluxe Edition\" of The Complete Masters.[52]\\nIn his late period, Coltrane showed an interest in the avant-garde jazz of Ornette Coleman,[53] Albert Ayler,[54] and Sun Ra. He was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler\\'s trio with bassist Gary Peacock,[55] who had worked with Paul Bley, and drummer Sunny Murray, whose playing was honed with Cecil Taylor as leader. Coltrane championed many young free jazz musicians such as Archie Shepp,[56] and under his influence Impulse! became a leading free jazz label.\\nAfter A Love Supreme was recorded, Ayler\\'s style became more prominent in Coltrane\\'s music. A series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane\\'s playing becoming abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like multiphonics, use of overtones, and playing in the altissimo register, as well as a mutated return of Coltrane\\'s sheets of sound. In the studio, he all but abandoned soprano saxophone to concentrate on tenor. The quartet responded by playing with increasing freedom. The group\\'s evolution can be traced through the albums The John Coltrane Quartet Plays, Living Space, Transition, New Thing at Newport, Sun Ship, and First Meditations.\\nIn June 1965, he went into Van Gelder\\'s studio with ten other musicians (including Shepp,[57] Pharoah Sanders,[57] Freddie Hubbard,[57] Marion Brown, and John Tchicai[57]) to record Ascension, a 38-minute piece that included solos by young avant-garde musicians.[56] The album was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited Sanders to join the band in September 1965. While Coltrane frequently used overblowing as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders \"was involved in the search for \\'human\\' sounds on his instrument,\"[58] employing \"a tone which blasted like a blow torch\"[59] and drastically expanding the vocabulary of his horn by employing multiphonics, growling, and \"high register squeals [that] could imitate not only the human song but the human cry and shriek as well.\"[60] Regarding Coltrane\\'s decision to add Sanders to the band, Gary Giddins wrote \"Those who had followed Coltrane to the edge of the galaxy now had the added challenge of a player who appeared to have little contact with earth.\"[61]\\nBy late 1965, Coltrane was regularly augmenting his group with Sanders and other free jazz musicians. Rashied Ali joined the group as a second drummer. This was the end of the quartet. Claiming he was unable to hear himself over the two drummers, Tyner left the band shortly after the recording of Meditations. Jones left in early 1966, dissatisfied by sharing drumming duties with Ali and stating that, concerning Coltrane\\'s latest music, \"only poets can understand it\".[62] In interviews, Tyner and Jones both voiced their displeasure with the music\\'s direction; however, they would incorporate some of the intensity of free jazz in their solo work. Later, both musicians expressed tremendous respect for Coltrane: regarding his late music, Jones stated: \"Well, of course it\\'s far out, because this is a tremendous mind that\\'s involved, you know. You wouldn\\'t expect Einstein to be playing jacks, would you?\"[63] Tyner recalled: \"He was constantly pushing forward. He never rested on his laurels, he was always looking for what\\'s next... he was always searching, like a scientist in a lab, looking for something new, a different direction... He kept hearing these sounds in his head...\"[64] Jones and Tyner both recorded tributes to Coltrane, Tyner with Echoes of a Friend (1972) and Blues for Coltrane: A Tribute to John Coltrane (1987), and Jones with Live in Japan 1978: Dear John C. (1978) and Tribute to John Coltrane \"A Love Supreme\" (1994).\\nThere is speculation that in 1965 Coltrane began using LSD,[65][66] informing the \"cosmic\" transcendence of his late period. Nat Hentoff wrote: \"it is as if he and Sanders were speaking with \\'the gift of tongues\\' - as if their insights were of such compelling force that they have to transcend ordinary ways of musical speech and ordinary textures to be able to convey that part of the essence of being they have touched.\"[67] After the departure of Tyner and Jones, Coltrane led a quintet with Sanders on tenor saxophone, his second wife Alice Coltrane on piano, Garrison on bass, and Ali on drums. When touring, the group was known for playing long versions of their repertoire, many stretching beyond 30 minutes to an hour. In concert, solos by band members often extended beyond fifteen minutes.\\nThe group can be heard on several concert recordings from 1966, including Live at the Village Vanguard Again! and Live in Japan. In 1967, Coltrane entered the studio several times. Although pieces with Sanders have surfaced (the unusual \"To Be\" has both men on flute), most of the recordings were either with the quartet minus Sanders (Expression and Stellar Regions) or as a duo with Ali. The latter duo produced six performances that appear on the album Interstellar Space.\\nColtrane died of liver cancer at the age of 40 on July 17, 1967, at Huntington Hospital on Long Island. His funeral was held four days later at St. Peter\\'s Lutheran Church in New York City. The service was started by the Albert Ayler Quartet and finished by the Ornette Coleman Quartet.[68] Coltrane is buried at Pinelawn Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York.[69]\\nBiographer Lewis Porter speculated that the cause of Coltrane\\'s illness was hepatitis, although he also attributed the disease to Coltrane\\'s heroin use at a previous period in his life.[70] Frederick J. Spencer wrote that Coltrane\\'s death could be attributed to his needle use \"or the bottle, or both.\"[71] He stated that \"[t]he needles he used to inject the drugs may have had everything to do with\" Coltrane\\'s liver disease: \"If any needle was contaminated with the appropriate hepatitis virus, it may have caused a chronic infection leading to cirrhosis or cancer.\"[71] He noted that despite Coltrane\\'s \"spiritual awakening\" in 1957, \"[b]y then, he may have had chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis... Unless he developed a primary focus elsewhere in later life and that spread to his liver, the seeds of John Coltrane’s cancer were sown in his days of addiction.\"[72]\\nColtrane\\'s death surprised many in the music community who were unaware of his condition. Miles Davis said, \"Coltrane\\'s death shocked everyone, took everyone by surprise. I knew he hadn\\'t looked too good... But I didn\\'t know he was that sick—or even sick at all.\"[73]\\nIn 1947, when he joined King Kolax\\'s band, Coltrane switched to tenor saxophone, the instrument he became known for playing.[74] In the early 1960s, during his engagement with Atlantic, he played soprano saxophone.[74]\\nHis preference for playing melody higher on the range of the tenor saxophone is attributed to his  training on alto horn and clarinet. His \"sound concept\", manipulated in one\\'s vocal tract, of the tenor was set higher than the normal range of the instrument.[75] Coltrane also noted how his experience playing the soprano saxophone gradually affected his style on the tenor, stating \"the soprano, by being this small instrument, I found that playing the lowest note on it was like playing... one of the middle notes in the tenor... I found that I would play all over this instrument... And on tenor, I hadn\\'t always played all over it, because I was playing certain ideas which would just run in certain ranges... By playing on the soprano and becoming accustomed to playing from that low B-flat on up, it soon got so when I went to tenor, I found myself doing the same thing... And this caused... the willingness to change and just try to play... as much of the instrument as possible.\"[76]\\nAccording to drummer John Densmore of The Doors, Coltrane was one of the first tenor saxophone players to switch from plastic mouthpieces to metal ones.[77] Since the tone differs between the two types of mouthpieces, Coltrane compensated by using a stiff No. 5 reed to produce a warmer sound.[77][dubious  – discuss]\\nToward the end of his career, he experimented with flute in his live performances and studio recordings (Live at the Village Vanguard Again!, Expression). After Eric Dolphy died in June 1964, his mother gave Coltrane his flute and bass clarinet.[78]\\nAccording to drummer Rashied Ali, Coltrane had an interest in the drums.[79] He would often have a spare drum set on concert stages that he would play.[80] His interest in the drums and his penchant for having solos with the drums resonated on tracks such as \"Pursuance\" and \"The Drum Thing\" from A Love Supreme and Crescent, respectively. It resulted in the album Interstellar Space with Ali.[81] In an interview with Nat Hentoff in late 1965 or early 1966, Coltrane stated: \"I feel the need for more time, more rhythm all around me. And with more than one drummer, the rhythm can be more multi-directional.\"[67] In an August 1966 interview with Frank Kofsky, Coltrane repeatedly emphasized his affinity for drums, saying \"I feel so strongly about drums, I really do.\"[82] Later that year, Coltrane would record the music released posthumously on Offering: Live at Temple University, which features Ali on drums supplemented by three percussionists.\\nColtrane\\'s tenor (Selmer Mark VI, serial number 125571, dated 1965) and soprano (Selmer Mark VI, serial number 99626, dated 1962) saxophones were auctioned on February 20, 2005 to raise money for the John Coltrane Foundation.[83]\\nAlthough he rarely played alto, he owned a prototype Yamaha alto saxophone given to him by the company as an endorsement in 1966. He can be heard playing it on live albums recorded in Japan, such as Second Night in Tokyo, and is pictured using it on the cover of the compilation Live in Japan. He can also be heard playing the Yamaha alto on the album Stellar Regions.[84]\\nColtrane was born and raised in a Christian home. He was influenced by religion and spirituality beginning in childhood. His maternal grandfather, the Reverend William Blair, was a minister at an African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church[85][86] in High Point, North Carolina, and his paternal grandfather, the Reverend William H. Coltrane, was an A.M.E. Zion minister in Hamlet, North Carolina.[85] Critic Norman Weinstein noted the parallel between Coltrane\\'s music and his experience in the southern church,[87] which included practicing music there as a youth.\\nIn 1955, Coltrane married Naima (née Juanita Grubbs). Naima Coltrane, a Muslim convert, heavily influenced his spirituality. When they married, she had a five-year-old daughter named Antonia, later named Syeeda. Coltrane adopted Syeeda. He met Naima at the home of bassist Steve Davis in Philadelphia. The love ballad he wrote to honor his wife, \"Naima\", was Coltrane\\'s favorite composition. In 1956 the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter in tow and moved to New York City. In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Syeeda moved into an apartment on 103rd St. and Amsterdam Ave. in New York. A few years later, John and Naima Coltrane purchased a home at 116-60 Mexico Street in St. Albans, Queens.[88] This is the house where they would break up in 1963.[89]\\nAbout the breakup, Naima said in J. C. Thomas\\'s Chasin\\' the Trane, \"I could feel it was going to happen sooner or later, so I wasn\\'t really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn\\'t offer any explanation. He just told me there were things he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. All he said was, \\'Naima, I\\'m going to make a change.\\' Even though I could feel it coming, it hurt, and I didn\\'t get over it for at least another year.\" But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90% of his playing would be prayer. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane died of a heart attack in October 1996.\\nIn 1957, Coltrane had a religious experience that may have helped him overcome the heroin addiction[90][91] and alcoholism[91] he had struggled with since 1948.[92] In the liner notes of A Love Supreme, Coltrane states that in 1957 he experienced \"by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music.\" The liner notes appear to mention God in a Universalist sense and do not advocate one religion over another.[93] Further evidence of this universal view can be found in the liner notes of Meditations (1965) in which Coltrane declares, \"I believe in all religions.\"[94]\\nIn 1963, he met pianist Alice McLeod.[95] He and Alice moved in together and had two sons before he became \"officially divorced from Naima in 1966, at which time [he] and Alice were immediately married.\"[94] John Jr. was born in 1964, Ravi in 1965, and Oranyan (\"Oran\") in 1967.[94] According to the musician Peter Lavezzoli, \"Alice brought happiness and stability to John\\'s life, not only because they had children, but also because they shared many of the same spiritual beliefs, particularly a mutual interest in Indian philosophy. Alice also understood what it was like to be a professional musician.\"[94]\\nAfter A Love Supreme, many of the titles of his songs and albums had spiritual connotations: Ascension, Meditations, Om, Selflessness, \"Amen\", \"Ascent\", \"Attaining\", \"Dear Lord\", \"Prayer and Meditation Suite\", and \"The Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost\".[94] His collection of books included The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, the Bhagavad Gita, and Paramahansa Yogananda\\'s Autobiography of a Yogi. The last of these describes, in Lavezzoli\\'s words, a \"search for universal truth, a journey that Coltrane had also undertaken. Yogananda believed that both Eastern and Western spiritual paths were efficacious, and wrote of the similarities between Krishna and Christ. This openness to different traditions resonated with Coltrane, who studied the Qur\\'an, the Bible, Kabbalah, and astrology with equal sincerity.\"[96] He also explored Hinduism, Jiddu Krishnamurti, African history, the philosophical teachings of Plato and Aristotle,[97] and Zen Buddhism.[98]\\nIn October 1965, Coltrane recorded Om, referring to the sacred syllable in Hinduism, which symbolizes the infinite or the entire universe. Coltrane described Om as the \"first syllable, the primal word, the word of power\".[99] The 29-minute recording contains chants from the Hindu Bhagavad Gita[100] and the Buddhist Tibetan Book of the Dead,[101] and a recitation of a passage describing the primal verbalization \"om\" as a cosmic/spiritual common denominator in all things.\\nColtrane\\'s spiritual journey was interwoven with his investigation of world music. He believed in not only a universal musical structure that transcended ethnic distinctions, but also being able to harness the mystical language of music itself. His study of Indian music led him to believe that certain sounds and scales could \"produce specific emotional meanings.\" According to Coltrane, the goal of a musician was to understand these forces, control them, and elicit a response from the audience. He said, \"I would like to bring to people something like happiness. I would like to discover a method so that if I want it to rain, it will start right away to rain. If one of my friends is ill, I\\'d like to play a certain song and he will be cured; when he\\'d be broke, I\\'d bring out a different song and immediately he\\'d receive all the money he needed.\"[102]\\nAfter Coltrane\\'s death, a congregation called the Yardbird Temple in San Francisco began worshiping him as God incarnate.[104] The group was named after Charlie Parker, whom they equated to John the Baptist.[104] The congregation became affiliated with the African Orthodox Church; this involved changing Coltrane\\'s status from a god to a saint.[104] The resultant St.\\xa0John Coltrane African Orthodox Church, San Francisco, is the only African Orthodox church that incorporates Coltrane\\'s music and his lyrics as prayers in its liturgy.[105]\\nRev. F. W. King, describing the African Orthodox Church of Saint John Coltrane, said \"We are Coltrane-conscious...God dwells in the musical majesty of his sounds.\"[106]\\n\\nSamuel G. Freedman wrote in The New York Times that ...\\xa0the Coltrane church is not a gimmick or a forced alloy of nightclub music and ethereal faith. Its message of deliverance through divine sound is actually quite consistent with Coltrane\\'s own experience and message. ... In both implicit and explicit ways, Coltrane also functioned as a religious figure. Addicted to heroin in the 1950s, he quit cold turkey, and later explained that he had heard the voice of God during his anguishing withdrawal. ... In 1966, an interviewer in Japan asked Coltrane what he hoped to be in five years, and Coltrane replied, \"a saint\".[104]Coltrane is depicted as one of the 90\\xa0saints in the Dancing Saints icon of St.\\xa0Gregory of Nyssa Episcopal Church in San Francisco. The icon is a 3,000-square-foot (280\\xa0m2) painting in the Byzantine iconographic style that wraps around the entire church rotunda. It was executed by Mark Dukes, an ordained deacon at the Saint John Coltrane African Orthodox Church who painted other icons of Coltrane for the Coltrane Church.[107] Saint Barnabas Episcopal Church in Newark, New Jersey, included Coltrane on its list of historical black saints and made a \"case for sainthood\" for him in an article on its website.[108]\\nDocumentaries about Coltrane and the church include Alan Klingenstein\\'s The Church of Saint Coltrane (1996),[109][110] and a 2004 program presented by Alan Yentob for the BBC.[111]\\nThe discography below lists albums conceived and approved by Coltrane as a leader during his lifetime. It does not include his many releases as a sideman, sessions assembled into albums by various record labels after Coltrane\\'s contract expired, sessions with Coltrane as a sideman later reissued with his name featured more prominently, or posthumous compilations, except for the one he approved before his death. See main discography link above for full list.\\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed John Coltrane among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[112]\\nIn 1965, Coltrane was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame. In 1972, A Love Supreme was certified gold by the RIAA for selling over half a million copies in Japan. This album was certified gold in the United States in 2001. In 1982 he was awarded a posthumous Grammy for Best Jazz Solo Performance on the album Bye Bye Blackbird, and in 1997 he was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[20] In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante named him one of his 100 Greatest African Americans.[113] He was awarded a special Pulitzer Prize in 2007 citing his \"masterful improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of jazz.\"[2] He was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009.[114]\\nA former home, the John Coltrane House in Philadelphia, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1999. His last home, the John Coltrane Home in the Dix Hills district of Huntington, New York, where he resided from 1964 until his death, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 29, 2007. Their son Ravi, named after Ravi Shankar, is also a saxophonist.\\nThe parent company of Impulse!, from 1965 to 1979 known as ABC Records, purged much of its unreleased material in the 1970s.[115]\\nAn early documentary on Jazz was made in 1990 by fellow musician Robert Palmer, called The World According to John Coltrane.\\nChasing Trane: The John Coltrane Documentary, is a 2016 American film directed by John Scheinfeld. Narrated by Denzel Washington, the film chronicles the life of Coltrane in his own words and includes interviews with such admirers as Wynton Marsalis, Sonny Rollins, Bill Clinton, and Cornel West.[116]\\n', 'Miles_Davis': '\\nMiles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926\\xa0– September 28, 1991) was an American trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.[1]\\nBorn in Alton, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, Davis left to study at Juilliard in New York City, before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker\\'s bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions for Capitol Records, which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz. In the early 1950s, Miles Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music while on Prestige Records but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955, he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records and recorded the 1957 album \\'Round About Midnight.[2] It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers, key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans, such as the Spanish music-influenced Sketches of Spain (1960), and band recordings, such as Milestones (1958) and Kind of Blue (1959).[3] The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time,[4] having sold over five million copies in the U.S.\\nDavis made several lineup changes while recording Someday My Prince Will Come (1961), his 1961 Blackhawk concerts, and Seven Steps to Heaven (1963), another mainstream success that introduced bassist Ron Carter, pianist Herbie Hancock, and drummer Tony Williams.[3] After adding saxophonist Wayne Shorter to his new quintet in 1964,[3] Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the post-bop genre with albums such as E.S.P (1965) and Miles Smiles (1967),[5] before transitioning into his electric period. During the 1970s, he experimented with rock, funk, African rhythms, emerging electronic music technology, and an ever-changing line-up of musicians, including keyboardist Joe Zawinul, drummer Al Foster, and guitarist John McLaughlin.[6] This period, beginning with Davis\\' 1969 studio album In a Silent Way and concluding with the 1975 concert recording Agharta, was the most controversial in his career, alienating and challenging many in jazz.[7] His million-selling 1970 record Bitches Brew helped spark a resurgence in the genre\\'s commercial popularity with jazz fusion as the decade progressed.[8]\\nAfter a five-year retirement due to poor health, Davis resumed his career in the 1980s, employing younger musicians and pop sounds on albums such as The Man with the Horn (1981) and Tutu (1986). Critics were often unreceptive but the decade garnered Davis his highest level of commercial recognition. He performed sold-out concerts worldwide, while branching out into visual arts, film, and television work, before his death in 1991 from the combined effects of a stroke, pneumonia and respiratory failure.[9] In 2006, Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,[10] which recognized him as \"one of the key figures in the history of jazz\".[10] Rolling Stone described him as \"the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time, not to mention one of the most important musicians of the 20th century,\"[9] while Gerald Early called him inarguably one of the most influential and innovative musicians of that period.[11]\\nMiles Dewey Davis III was born on May 26, 1926, to an affluent African-American family in Alton, Illinois, 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of St. Louis.[12][13] He had an older sister, Dorothy Mae (born 1925), and a younger brother, Vernon (born 1929). His mother, Cleota Mae Henry of Arkansas, was a music teacher and violinist, and his father, Miles Dewey Davis Jr., also of Arkansas, was a dentist. They owned a 200-acre (81\\xa0ha) estate near Pine Bluff, Arkansas with a profitable pig farm. In Pine Bluff, he and his siblings fished, hunted, and rode horses.[14][15] Davis\\' grandparents were the owners of an Arkansas farm where he would spend many summers.[16]\\nIn 1927, the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois. They lived on the second floor of a commercial building behind a dental office in a predominantly white neighbourhood. Davis\\' father would soon become distant to his children as the Great Depression caused him to become increasingly consumed by his job; typically working six days a week.[16] From 1932 to 1934, Davis attended John Robinson Elementary School, an all-black school,[13] then Crispus Attucks, where he performed well in mathematics, music, and sports.[15] Davis had previously attended Catholic school.[16] At an early age he liked music, especially blues, big bands, and gospel.[14]\\nIn 1935, Davis received his first trumpet as a gift from John Eubanks, a friend of his father.[17] He took lessons from \"the biggest influence on my life,\" Elwood Buchanan, a teacher and musician who was a patient of his father.[12][18] His mother wanted him to play the violin instead.[19] Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without vibrato and encouraged him to use a clear, mid-range tone. Davis said that whenever he started playing with heavy vibrato, Buchanan slapped his knuckles.[19][12][20] In later years Davis said, \"I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I can\\'t get that sound I can\\'t play anything.\"[21] The family soon moved to 1701 Kansas Avenue in East St. Louis.[16]\\nAccording to Davis \"By the age of 12, music had become the most important thing in my life.\"[18] On his thirteenth birthday his father bought him a new trumpet,[17] and Davis began to play in local bands. He took additional trumpet lessons from Joseph Gustat, principal trumpeter of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra.[17] Davis would also play the trumpet in talent shows he and his siblings would put on.[16]\\nIn 1941, the 15-year-old attended East St. Louis Lincoln High School, where he joined the marching band directed by Buchanan and entered music competitions. Years later, Davis said that he was discriminated against in these competitions due to his race, but he added that these experiences made him a better musician.[15] When a drummer asked him to play a certain passage of music, and he couldn\\'t do it, he began to learn music theory. \"I went and got everything, every book I could get to learn about theory.\"[22] At Lincoln, Davis met his first girlfriend, Irene Birth (later Cawthon).[23] He had a band that performed at the Elks Club.[24] Part of his earnings paid for his sister\\'s education at Fisk University.[25] Davis befriended trumpeter Clark Terry, who suggested he play without vibrato, and performed with him for several years.[17][25]\\nWith encouragement from his teacher and girlfriend, Davis filled a vacant spot in the Rhumboogie Orchestra, also known as the Blue Devils, led by Eddie Randle. He became the band\\'s musical director, which involved hiring musicians and scheduling rehearsal.[26][25] Years later, Davis considered this job one of the most important of his career.[22] Sonny Stitt tried to persuade him to join the Tiny Bradshaw band, which was passing through town, but his mother insisted he finish high school before going on tour. He said later, \"I didn\\'t talk to her for two weeks. And I didn\\'t go with the band either.\"[27] In January 1944, Davis finished high school and graduated in absentia in June. During the next month, his girlfriend gave birth to a daughter, Cheryl.[25]\\nIn July 1944, Billy Eckstine visited St. Louis with a band that included Art Blakey, Dizzy Gillespie, and Charlie Parker. Trumpeter Buddy Anderson was too sick to perform,[12] so Davis was invited to join. He played with the band for two weeks at Club Riviera.[25][28] After playing with these musicians, he was certain he should move to New York City, \"where the action was\".[29] His mother wanted him to go to Fisk University, like his sister, and study piano or violin. Davis had other interests.[27]\\nIn September 1944, Davis accepted his father\\'s idea of studying at the Institute of Musical Arts, later known as the Juilliard School, in New York City.[25] After passing the audition, he attended classes in music theory, piano and dictation.[30] Davis would frequently skip said classes.[31]\\nMuch of Davis\\' time was spent in clubs looking for his idol, Charlie Parker. According to Davis, Coleman Hawkins told him \"finish your studies at Juilliard and forget Bird [Parker]\".[32][28] After finding Parker, he became one of a cadre of regulars at Minton\\'s and Monroe\\'s in Harlem who held jam sessions every night. The other regulars included J. J. Johnson, Kenny Clarke, Thelonious Monk, Fats Navarro, and Freddie Webster. Davis reunited with Cawthon and their daughter when they moved to New York City. Parker became a roommate.[28][25] Around this time Davis was paid an allowance of $40 ($582 by 2020).[33][34]\\nIn mid-1945, Davis failed to register for the year\\'s autumn term at Juilliard and dropped out after three semesters[14][35][25] because he wanted to perform full-time.[36] Years later he criticized Juilliard for concentrating too much on classical European and \"white\" repertoire, but he praised the school for teaching him music theory and improving his trumpet technique.\\nHe began performing at clubs on 52nd Street with Coleman Hawkins and Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis. He recorded for the first time on April 24, 1945 when he entered the studio as a sideman for Herbie Fields\\'s band.[25][28] During the next year, he recorded as a leader for the first time with the Miles Davis Sextet plus Earl Coleman and Ann Hathaway, one of the few times he accompanied a singer.[37]\\nIn 1945, he replaced Dizzy Gillespie in Charlie Parker\\'s quintet. On November 26, Davis participated in several recording sessions as part of Parker\\'s group Reboppers that also involved Gillespie and Max Roach,[25] displaying hints of the style he would become known for. In Parker\\'s tune \"Now\\'s the Time\", Davis played a solo that anticipated cool jazz. He then joined a big band led by Benny Carter, performing in St. Louis and remaining with the band in California. He again played with Parker and Gillespie.[38] In Los Angeles, Parker had a nervous breakdown that put him in the hospital for several months.[38][39] In March 1946, Davis played in studio sessions with Parker and began a collaboration with bassist Charles Mingus that summer. Cawthon gave birth to Davis\\'s second child, Gregory, in East St. Louis before reuniting with Davis in New York City the following year.[38] Davis noted that by this time, \"I was still so much into the music that I was even ignoring Irene.\" He had also turned to alcohol and cocaine.[40]\\nHe was a member of Billy Eckstine\\'s big band in 1946 and Gillespie\\'s in 1947.[41] He joined a quintet led by Parker that also included Max Roach. Together they performed live with Duke Jordan and Tommy Potter for much of the year, including several studio sessions.[38] In one session that May, Davis wrote the tune \"Cheryl\", named after his daughter. Davis\\'s first session as a leader followed in August 1947, playing as the Miles Davis All Stars that included Parker, pianist John Lewis, and bassist Nelson Boyd; they recorded \"Milestones\", \"Half Nelson\", and \"Sippin\\' at Bells\".[42][38] After touring Chicago and Detroit with Parker\\'s quintet, Davis returned to New York City in March 1948 and joined the Jazz at the Philharmonic tour, which included a stop in St. Louis on April 30.[38]\\nIn August 1948, Davis declined an offer to join Duke Ellington\\'s orchestra as he had entered rehearsals with a nine-piece band with pianist and arranger Gil Evans and baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan, taking an active role on what soon became his own project.[43][38] Evans\\' Manhattan apartment had become the meeting place for several young musicians and composers such as Davis, Roach, Lewis, and Mulligan who were unhappy with the increasingly virtuoso instrumental techniques that dominated bebop.[44] These gatherings led to the formation of the Miles Davis Nonet, which included the unusual additions of French horn and tuba; leading to a thickly textured orchestral sound.[31] The intent was to imitate the human voice through carefully arranged compositions and a relaxed, melodic approach to improvisation. In September, the band completed their sole engagement as the opening band for Count Basie at the Royal Roost for two weeks. Davis had to persuade the venue\\'s manager to write the sign \"Miles Davis Nonet. Arrangements by Gil Evans, John Lewis and Gerry Mulligan\". Davis returned to Parker\\'s quintet, but relationships within the quintet were growing tense mainly due to Parker\\'s erratic behavior caused by his drug addiction.[38] Early in his time with Parker, Davis abstained from drugs, ate a vegetarian diet, and spoke of the benefits of water and juice.[45]\\nIn December 1948 Davis quit,[38] claiming he was not being paid. His departure began a period when he worked mainly as a freelancer and sideman. His nonet remained active until the end of 1949. After signing a contract with Capitol Records, they recorded sessions in January and April 1949, which sold little but influenced the \"cool\" or \"west coast\" style of jazz.[38] The line-up changed throughout the year and included the additions of tuba player Bill Barber, alto saxophonist Lee Konitz, pianist Al Haig, trombone players Mike Zwerin with Kai Winding, French horn players Junior Collins with Sandy Siegelstein and Gunther Schuller, and bassists Al McKibbon and Joe Shulman. One track featured singer Kenny Hagood. The presence of white musicians in the group angered some black players, many of whom were unemployed at the time, yet Davis rebuffed their criticisms.[46] Recording sessions with the nonet for Capitol continued until April 1950. The Nonet recorded in total a dozen tracks which were released as singles and subsequently compiled on the 1957 album Birth of the Cool.[31]\\nIn May 1949, Davis performed with the Tadd Dameron Quintet with Kenny Clarke and James Moody at the Paris International Jazz Festival. On his first trip abroad Davis took a strong liking for Paris and its cultural environment, where he felt black jazz musicians and people of color in general were better respected than in the U.S. The trip, he said, \"changed the way I looked at things forever\".[47] He began an affair with singer and actress Juliette Gréco.[47]\\nAfter returning from Paris in mid-1949, he became depressed and found little work, which included a short engagement with Powell in October and guest spots in New York City, Chicago, and Detroit until January 1950.[48] He was falling behind in hotel rent and attempts were made to repossess his car. His heroin use became an expensive addiction, and Davis, yet to reach 24 years old, \"lost my sense of discipline, lost my sense of control over my life, and started to drift\".[49][38] In August 1950, Cawthon gave birth to Davis\\'s second son, Miles IV. Davis befriended boxer Johnny Bratton and began his interest in the sport. Davis left Cawthon and his three children in New York City in the hands of a friend, jazz singer Betty Carter.[48] He toured with Eckstine and Billie Holiday and was arrested for heroin possession in Los Angeles. The story was reported in DownBeat magazine, which caused a further reduction in work, though he was acquitted weeks later.[50] By the 1950s, Davis had become a more skilled player and was experimenting with the middle register of the trumpet alongside harmonies and rhythms.[31]\\nIn January 1951, Davis\\'s fortunes improved when he signed a one-year contract with Prestige after owner Bob Weinstock became a fan of the nonet [51] Davis chose Lewis, trombonist Bennie Green, bassist Percy Heath, saxophonist Sonny Rollins, and drummer Roy Haynes; they recorded what became part of Miles Davis and Horns (1956). Davis was hired for other studio dates in 1951[50] and began to transcribe scores for record labels to fund his heroin addiction. His second session for Prestige was released on The New Sounds (1951), Dig (1956), and Conception (1956).[52]\\nDavis supported his heroin habit by playing music and by living the life of a hustler, exploiting prostitutes, and receiving money from friends. By 1953, his addiction began to impair his playing. His drug habit became public in a DownBeat interview with Cab Calloway, whom he never forgave as it brought him \"all pain and suffering\".[53] He returned to St. Louis and stayed with his father for several months.[53] After a brief period with Roach and Mingus in September 1953,[54] he returned to his father\\'s home, where he concentrated on addressing his addiction.[55]\\nDavis lived in Detroit for about six months, avoiding New York City, where it was easy to get drugs. Though he used heroin, he was still able to perform locally with Elvin Jones and Tommy Flanagan as part of Billy Mitchell\\'s house band at the Blue Bird club. He was also \"pimping a little\".[56] However, he was able to end his addiction, and, in February 1954, Davis returned to New York City, feeling good \"for the first time in a long time\", mentally and physically stronger, and joined a gym.[57] He informed Weinstock and Blue Note that he was ready to record with a quintet, which he was granted. He considered the albums that resulted from these and earlier sessions – Miles Davis Quartet and Miles Davis Volume 2 – \"very important\" because he felt his performances were particularly strong.[58] He was paid roughly $750 (US$7,140 in 2019 dollars[59]) for each album and refused to give away his publishing rights.[60]\\nDavis abandoned the bebop style and turned to the music of pianist Ahmad Jamal, whose approach and use of space influenced him.[61] When he returned to the studio in June 1955 to record The Musings of Miles, he wanted a pianist like Jamal and chose Red Garland.[61] Blue Haze (1956), Bags\\' Groove (1957), Walkin\\' (1957), and Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants (1959) documented the evolution of his sound with the Harmon mute, also known as a wah-wah mute, placed close to the microphone, and the use of more spacious and relaxed phrasing. He assumed a central role in hard bop, less radical in harmony and melody, and used popular songs and American standards as starting points for improvisation. Hard bop distanced itself from cool jazz with a harder beat and music inspired by the blues.[62] A few critics consider Walkin\\' (April 1954) the album that created the hard bop genre.[21]\\nDavis gained a reputation for being cold, distant—and easily angered. He wrote that in 1954 Sugar Ray Robinson \"was the most important thing in my life besides music\" and adopted Robinson\\'s \"arrogant attitude\".[63] He showed contempt for critics and the press.\\nDavis had an operation to remove polyps from his larynx in October 1955.[64] The doctors told him to remain silent after the operation, but he got into an argument that permanently damaged his vocal cords and gave him a raspy voice for the rest of his life.[65] He was called the \"prince of darkness\", adding a patina of mystery to his public persona.[a]\\nIn July 1955, Davis\\'s fortunes improved considerably when he played at the Newport Jazz Festival, with a line-up of Monk, Heath, drummer Connie Kay, and horn players Zoot Sims and Gerry Mulligan.[69][70] The performance was praised by critics and audiences alike, who considered it to be a highlight of the session as well as helping Davis, the least well known musician in the group, to increase his popularity among affluent white audiences.[71][70] He tied with Dizzy Gillespie for best trumpeter in the 1955 DownBeat magazine Readers\\' Poll.[72]\\nGeorge Avakian of Columbia Records heard Davis perform at Newport and wanted to sign him to the label. Davis had one year left on his contract with Prestige, which required him to release four more albums. He signed a contract with Columbia that included a $4,000 advance (US$38,176 in 2019 dollars[59]) and a condition that his recordings for Columbia would remain unreleased until his agreement with Prestige expired.[73][74]\\nAt the request of Avakian, he formed the Miles Davis Quintet for a performance at Café Bohemia. The quintet contained Sonny Rollins on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on double bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums. Rollins was replaced by John Coltrane, completing the membership of the first quintet. This group appeared on his final albums for Prestige, which were recorded in two one-day sessions in 1956. Each album helped establish Davis\\'s quintet as one of the best.[75][76][77]\\nThe style of the group was an extension of their experience playing with Davis. He played long, legato, melodic lines, while Coltrane contrasted with energetic solos. Their live repertoire was a mix of bebop, standards from the Great American Songbook and pre-bop eras, and traditional tunes. They appeared on \\'Round About Midnight, Davis\\'s first album for Columbia.\\nIn 1956, he left his quintet temporarily to tour Europe as part of the Birdland All-Stars, which included the Modern Jazz Quartet and French and German musicians. In Paris, he reunited with Gréco and they \"remained lovers for many years\".[78][79] He then returned home, reunited his quintet and toured the US for two months. Conflict arose on tour as he grew impatient with the drug habits of Jones and Coltrane. Davis was trying to live a healthier life by exercising and reducing his alcohol. But he continued to use cocaine.[80] At the end of the tour, he fired Jones and Coltrane and replaced them with Sonny Rollins and Art Taylor.[81]\\nIn November 1957, Davis went to Paris and recorded the soundtrack to Ascenseur pour l\\'échafaud[41] directed by Louis Malle. Consisting of French jazz musicians Barney Wilen, Pierre Michelot, and René Urtreger, and American drummer Kenny Clarke, the group avoided a written score and instead improvised while they watched the film in a recording studio.\\nAfter returning to New York, Davis revived his quintet with Adderley[41] and Coltrane, who was clean from his drug habit. Now a sextet, the group recorded material in early 1958 that was released on Milestones, an album that demonstrated Davis\\'s interest in modal jazz. A performance by Les Ballets Africains drew him to slower, deliberate music that allowed the creation of solos from harmony rather than chords.[82]\\nBy May 1958, he had replaced Jones with drummer Jimmy Cobb, and Garland left the group, leaving Davis to play piano on \"Sid\\'s Ahead\" for Milestones.[83] He wanted someone who could play modal jazz, so he hired Bill Evans, a young pianist with a background in classical music.[84] Evans had an impressionistic approach to piano. His ideas greatly influenced Davis. But after eight months of touring, a tired Evans left. Wynton Kelly, his replacement, brought to the group a swinging style that contrasted with Evans\\'s delicacy. The sextet made their recording debut on Jazz Track (1958).[84]\\nBy early 1957, Davis was exhausted from recording and touring and wished to pursue new projects. In March, the 30-year-old Davis told journalists of his intention to retire imminently and revealed offers he had received to become a teacher at Harvard University and a musical director at a record label.[85][86] Avakian agreed that it was time for Davis to explore something different, but Davis rejected his suggestion of returning to his nonet as he considered that a step backward.[86] Avakian then suggested that he work with a bigger ensemble, similar to Music for Brass (1957), an album of orchestral and brass-arranged music led by Gunther Schuller featuring Davis as a guest soloist.\\nDavis accepted and worked with Gil Evans in what became a five-album collaboration from 1957 to 1962.[87] Miles Ahead (1957) showcased Davis on flugelhorn and a rendition of \"The Maids of Cadiz\" by Léo Delibes, the first piece of classical music that Davis recorded. Evans devised orchestral passages as transitions, thus turning the album into one long piece of music.[88][89] Porgy and Bess (1959) includes arrangements of pieces from George Gershwin\\'s opera. Sketches of Spain (1960) contained music by Joaquín Rodrigo and Manuel de Falla and originals by Evans. The classical musicians had trouble improvising, while the jazz musicians couldn\\'t handle the difficult arrangements, but the album was a critical success, selling over 120,000 copies in the US.[90] Davis performed with an orchestra conducted by Evans at Carnegie Hall in May 1961 to raise money for charity.[91] The pair\\'s final album was Quiet Nights (1962), a collection of bossa nova songs released against their wishes. Evans stated it was only half an album and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer Teo Macero and refused to speak to him for more than two years.[92] The boxed set Miles Davis & Gil Evans: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings (1996) won the Grammy Award for Best Historical Album and Best Album Notes in 1997.\\nIn March and April 1959, Davis recorded what many critics consider his greatest album, Kind of Blue. He named the album for its mood.[93] He called back Bill Evans, as the music had been planned around Evans\\'s piano style.[94] Both Davis and Evans were familiar with George Russell\\'s ideas about modal jazz.[95][96] But Davis neglected to tell pianist Wynton Kelly that Evans was returning, so Kelly appeared on only one song, \"Freddie Freeloader\". [94] The sextet had played \"So What\" and \"All Blues\" at performances, but the remaining three compositions they saw for the first time in the studio.\\nReleased in August 1959, Kind of Blue was an instant success, with widespread radio airplay and rave reviews from critics.[93] It remains the best selling jazz album of all time. In October 2008, the album reached 4× platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over four million copies in the US.[97] In 2009, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution that honored it as a national treasure.[98][99]\\nIn August 1959, during a break in a recording session at the Birdland nightclub in New York City, Davis was escorting a blonde-haired woman to a taxi outside the club when policeman Gerald Kilduff told him to \"move on\".[100][101] Davis said that he was working at the club, and he refused to move.[102] Kilduff arrested him and grabbed him as he tried to protect himself.[101] Witnesses said the policeman hit Davis in the stomach with a nightstick without provocation.[101] Two detectives held the crowd back, while a third approached Davis from behind and beat him over the head. Davis was taken to jail, charged with assaulting an officer, then taken to the hospital where he received five stitches.[101] By January 1960, he was acquitted of disorderly conduct and third-degree assault.[103] He later stated the incident \"changed my whole life and whole attitude again, made me feel bitter and cynical again when I was starting to feel good about the things that had changed in this country\".[103]\\nDavis and his sextet toured to support Kind of Blue.[93] He persuaded Coltrane to play with the group on one final European tour in the spring of 1960. Coltrane then departed to form his quartet, though he returned for some tracks on Davis\\'s album Someday My Prince Will Come (1961). Its front cover shows a photograph of his wife, Frances Taylor, after Davis demanded that Columbia depict black women on his album covers.[104] In 1957,[105] Davis began a relationship with Taylor, a dancer he had met in 1953 at Ciro\\'s in Los Angeles.[106][107] They married in December 1959 in Toledo, Ohio.[108] The relationship involved numerous incidents of Davis\\' domestic violence towards Taylor. He later wrote, \"Every time I hit her, I felt bad because a lot of it really wasn\\'t her fault but had to do with me being temperamental and jealous.\"[109][110][111] One reason for his behavior was that in 1963 he had increased his use of alcohol and cocaine to reduce joint pain caused by sickle cell anemia.[112][113] He hallucinated, \"looking for this imaginary person\" in his house while wielding a kitchen knife. Soon after the photograph for the album E.S.P. (1965) was taken, Taylor left him for the final time.[114] She filed for divorce in 1966; it was finalized in February 1968.[115][116]\\nIn December 1962, Davis, Kelly, Chambers, Cobb, and Rollins played together for the last time as the first three wanted to leave and play as a trio. Rollins left them soon after, leaving Davis to pay over $25,000 (US$211,304 in 2019 dollars[59]) to cancel upcoming gigs and quickly assemble a new group. Following auditions, he found his new band in tenor saxophonist George Coleman, bassist Ron Carter, pianist Victor Feldman, and drummer Frank Butler.[117] By May 1963, Feldman and Butler were replaced by pianist Herbie Hancock and 17-year-old drummer Tony Williams who made Davis \"excited all over again\".[118] With this group, Davis completed the rest of what became Seven Steps to Heaven (1963) and recorded the live albums Miles Davis in Europe (1964), My Funny Valentine (1965), and Four & More (1966). The quintet played essentially the same bebop tunes and standards that Davis\\'s previous bands had played, but they approached them with structural and rhythmic freedom and occasionally breakneck speed.\\nIn 1964, Coleman was briefly replaced by saxophonist Sam Rivers (who recorded with Davis on Miles in Tokyo) until  Wayne Shorter was persuaded to leave Art Blakey. The quintet with Shorter lasted through 1968, with the saxophonist becoming the group\\'s principal composer. The album E.S.P. (1965) was named after his composition. While touring Europe, the group made its first album, Miles in Berlin (1965).[119]\\nDavis needed medical attention for hip pain, which had worsened since his Japanese tour during the previous year.[120] He underwent hip replacement surgery in April 1965, with bone taken from his shin, but it failed. After his third month in the hospital, he discharged himself due to boredom and went home. He returned to the hospital in August after a fall required the insertion of a plastic hip joint.[121] In November 1965, he had recovered enough to return to performing with his quintet, which included gigs at the Plugged Nickel in Chicago. Teo Macero returned as his record producer after their rift over Quiet Nights had healed.[122][123]\\nIn January 1966, Davis spent three months in the hospital due to a liver infection. When he resumed touring, he performed more at colleges because he had grown tired of the typical jazz venues.[124] Columbia president Clive Davis reported in 1966 his sales had declined to around 40,000–50,000 per album, compared to as many as 100,000 per release a few years before. Matters were not helped by the press reporting his apparent financial troubles and imminent demise.[125] After his appearance at the 1966 Newport Jazz Festival, he returned to the studio with his quintet for a series of sessions. He started a relationship with actress Cicely Tyson, who helped him reduce his alcohol consumption.[126]\\nMaterial from the 1966–1968 sessions was released on Miles Smiles (1966), Sorcerer (1967), Nefertiti (1967), Miles in the Sky (1968), and Filles de Kilimanjaro (1968). The quintet\\'s approach to the new music became known as \"time no changes\"—which referred to Davis\\'s decision to depart from chordal sequences and adopt a more open approach, with the rhythm section responding to the soloists\\' melodies.[127] Through Nefertiti the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of change. His bands performed this way until his hiatus in 1975.\\nMiles in the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro—which tentatively introduced electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar on some tracks—pointed the way to the fusion phase of Davis\\'s career. He also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of Filles de Kilimanjaro was recorded, bassist Dave Holland and pianist Chick Corea had replaced Carter and Hancock. Davis soon took over the compositional duties of his sidemen.\\nIn September 1968, Davis married 23-year-old model and songwriter Betty Mabry.[128] In his autobiography, Davis described her as a \"high-class groupie, who was very talented but who didn\\'t believe in her own talent\".[129] Mabry, a familiar face in the New York City counterculture, helped introduce Davis to popular rock, soul, and funk musicians.[130] Jazz critic Leonard Feather visited Davis\\'s apartment and was shocked to find him listening to albums by The Byrds, Aretha Franklin, and Dionne Warwick. He also liked James Brown, Sly and the Family Stone, and Jimi Hendrix,[131] whose group Band of Gypsys particularly made an impression on Davis.[132] Davis filed for divorce from Mabry in 1969, after accusing her of having an affair with Jimi Hendrix.[129]\\nIn a Silent Way was recorded in a single studio session in February 1969, with Shorter, Hancock, Holland, and Williams alongside keyboardists Chick Corea and Josef Zawinul and guitarist John McLaughlin. The album contains two side-long tracks that Macero pieced together from different takes recorded at the session. When the album was released later that year, some critics accused him of \"selling out\" to the rock and roll audience. Nevertheless, it reached number 134 on the US Billboard Top LPs chart, his first album since My Funny Valentine to reach the chart. In a Silent Way was his entry into jazz fusion. The touring band of 1969–1970—with Shorter, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette—never completed a studio recording together, and became known as Davis\\'s \"lost quintet\".[133][134]\\nIn October 1969, Davis was shot at five times while in his car with one of his two lovers, Marguerite Eskridge. The incident left him with a graze and Eskridge unharmed.[135] In 1970, Marguerite gave birth to their son Erin.\\nFor the double album Bitches Brew (1970), he hired Jack DeJohnette, Airto Moreira, and Bennie Maupin. The album contained long compositions, some over twenty minutes, that were never played in the studio but were constructed from several takes by Macero and Davis. Other studio techniques included splicing, multitrack recording, and tape loops.[136] Bitches Brew peaked at No. 35 on the Billboard Album chart.[137] In 1976, it was certified gold for selling over 500,000 records. By 2003, it had sold one million copies.[97]\\nIn March 1970, Davis began to perform as the opening act for rock acts, allowing Columbia to market Bitches Brew to a larger audience. He shared a Fillmore East bill with the Steve Miller Band and Neil Young with Crazy Horse on March 6 and 7.[135] Biographer Paul Tingen wrote, \"Miles\\' newcomer status in this environment\" led to \"mixed audience reactions, often having to play for dramatically reduced fees, and enduring the \\'sell-out\\' accusations from the jazz world\", as well as being \"attacked by sections of the black press for supposedly genuflecting to white culture\".[138] The 1970 tours included the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival on August 29 when he performed to an estimated 600,000 people, the largest of his career.[139] Plans to record with Hendrix ended after the guitarist\\'s death; his funeral was the last that Davis attended.[140] Several live albums with a transitional sextet/septet including Corea, DeJohnette, Holland, Moreira, saxophonist Steve Grossman, and keyboardist Keith Jarrett were recorded during this period, including Miles Davis at Fillmore (1970) and Black Beauty: Miles Davis at Fillmore West (1973).[10]\\nBy 1971, Davis had signed a contract with Columbia that paid him $100,000 a year (US$631,306 in 2019 dollars[59]) for three years in addition to royalties.[141] He recorded a soundtrack album (Jack Johnson) for the 1970 documentary film about heavyweight boxer Jack Johnson, containing two long pieces of 25 and 26 minutes in length with Hancock, McLaughlin, Sonny Sharrock, and Billy Cobham. He was committed to making music for African-Americans who liked more commercial, pop, groove-oriented music. By November 1971, DeJohnette and Moreira had been replaced in the touring ensemble by drummer Leon \"Ndugu\" Chancler and percussionists James Mtume and Don Alias.[142] Live-Evil was released in the same month. Showcasing bassist Michael Henderson, who had replaced Holland in 1970, the album demonstrated that Davis\\'s ensemble had transformed into a funk-oriented group while retaining the exploratory imperative of Bitches Brew.\\nIn 1972, composer-arranger Paul Buckmaster introduced Davis to the music of avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, leading to a period of creative exploration. Biographer J. K. Chambers wrote, \"The effect of Davis\\' study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long ... Davis\\' own \\'space music\\' shows Stockhausen\\'s influence compositionally.\"[143] His recordings and performances during this period were described as \"space music\" by fans, Feather, and Buckmaster, who described it as \"a lot of mood changes—heavy, dark, intense—definitely space music\".[144][145] The studio album On the Corner (1972) blended the influence of Stockhausen and Buckmaster with funk elements. Davis invited Buckmaster to New York City to oversee the writing and recording of the album with Macero.[146] The album reached No. 1 on the Billboard jazz chart but peaked at No. 156 on the more heterogeneous Top 200 Albums chart. Davis felt that Columbia marketed it to the wrong audience. \"The music was meant to be heard by young black people, but they just treated it like any other jazz album and advertised it that way, pushed it on the jazz radio stations. Young black kids don\\'t listen to those stations; they listen to R&B stations and some rock stations.\"[147] In October 1972, he broke his ankles in a car crash. He took painkillers and cocaine to cope with the pain.[148] Looking back at his career after the incident, he wrote, \"Everything started to blur.\"[149]\\n— John Szwed on Agharta (1975) and Pangaea (1976)[150]\\nAfter recording On the Corner, he assembled a group with Henderson, Mtume, Carlos Garnett, guitarist Reggie Lucas, organist Lonnie Liston Smith, tabla player Badal Roy, sitarist Khalil Balakrishna, and drummer Al Foster. Only Smith was a jazz instrumentalist; consequently, the music emphasized rhythmic density and shifting textures instead of solos. This group was recorded live in 1972 for In Concert, but Davis found it unsatisfactory, leading him to drop the tabla and sitar and play keyboards. He also added guitarist Pete Cosey. The compilation studio album Big Fun contains four long improvisations recorded between 1969 and 1972.\\nStudio sessions throughout 1973 and 1974 led to Get Up with It, an album which included four long pieces alongside four shorter recordings from 1970 and 1972. The track \"He Loved Him Madly\", a thirty-minute tribute to the recently deceased Duke Ellington, presaged later developments in ambient music.[151] In the United States, it performed comparably to On the Corner, reaching number 8 on the jazz chart and number 141 on the pop chart. He then concentrated on live performance with a series of concerts that Columbia released on the double live albums Agharta (1975), Pangaea (1976), and Dark Magus (1977). The first two are recordings of two sets from February 1, 1975 in Osaka, by which time Davis was troubled by several physical ailments; he relied on alcohol, codeine, and morphine to get through the engagements. His shows were routinely panned by critics who mentioned his habit of performing with his back to the audience.[152] Cosey later asserted that \"the band really advanced after the Japanese tour\",[153] but Davis was again hospitalized, for his ulcers and a hernia, during a tour of the US while opening for Herbie Hancock.\\nAfter appearances at the 1975 Newport Jazz Festival in July and the Schaefer Music Festival in New York in September, Davis dropped out of music.[154][155]\\nIn his autobiography, Davis wrote frankly about his life during his hiatus from music. He called his Upper West Side brownstone a wreck and chronicled his heavy use of alcohol and cocaine, in addition to his sexual encounters with many women.[156] He also stated that \"Sex and drugs took the place music had occupied in my life.\" Drummer Tony Williams recalled that by noon (on average) Davis would be sick from the previous night\\'s intake.[157]\\nIn December 1975, he had regained enough strength to undergo a much needed hip replacement operation.[158] In December 1976, Columbia was reluctant to renew his contract and pay his usual large advances. But after his lawyer started negotiating with United Artists, Columbia matched their offer, establishing the Miles Davis Fund to pay him regularly. Pianist Vladimir Horowitz was the only other musician with Columbia who had a similar status.[159]\\nIn 1978, Davis asked fusion guitarist Larry Coryell to participate in sessions with keyboardists Masabumi Kikuchi and George Pavlis, bassist T. M. Stevens, and drummer Al Foster.[160] Davis played the arranged piece uptempo, abandoned his trumpet for the organ, and had Macero record the session without the band\\'s knowledge. After Coryell declined a spot in a band that Davis was beginning to put together, Davis returned to his reclusive lifestyle in New York City.[161][162] Soon after, Marguerite Eskridge had Davis jailed for failing to pay child support to their son Erin, which cost him $10,000 (US$39,199 in 2019 dollars[59]) for release on bail.[160][158] A recording session that involved Buckmaster and Gil Evans was halted,[163] with Evans leaving after failing to receive the payment he was promised. In August 1978, Davis hired a new manager, Mark Rothbaum, who had worked with him since 1972.[164]\\nBy 1979, Davis had rekindled his relationship with actress Cicely Tyson, with whom he overcame his cocaine addiction and regained his enthusiasm for music. The two married in November 1981,[165][166] but their tumultuous marriage ended with Tyson filing for divorce in 1988, which was finalized in 1989.[167]\\nHaving played the trumpet little throughout the previous three years, Davis found it difficult to reclaim his embouchure. His first post-hiatus studio appearance took place in May 1980.[168] A day later, Davis was hospitalized due to a leg infection.[169] He recorded The Man with the Horn from June 1980 to May 1981 with Macero producing. A large band was abandoned in favor of a combo with saxophonist Bill Evans and bassist Marcus Miller. Both would collaborate with him during the next decade.\\nThe Man with the Horn received a poor critical reception despite selling well. In June 1981, Davis returned to the stage for the first time since 1975 in a ten-minute guest solo as part of Mel Lewis\\'s band at the Village Vanguard.[170] This was followed by appearances with a new band.[171][172] Recordings from a mixture of dates from 1981, including from the Kix in Boston and Avery Fisher Hall, were released on We Want Miles,[173] which earned him a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance by a Soloist.[174]\\nIn January 1982, while Tyson was working in Africa, Davis \"went a little wild\" with alcohol, and suffered a stroke that temporarily paralyzed his right hand.[175][176] Tyson returned home and cared for him. After three months of treatment with a Chinese acupuncturist, he was able to play the trumpet again. He listened to his doctor\\'s warnings and gave up alcohol and drugs. He credited Tyson with helping his recovery, which involved exercise, piano playing, and visits to spas. She encouraged him to draw, which he pursued for the rest of his life.[175]\\nDavis resumed touring in May 1982 with a line-up that included percussionist Mino Cinelu and guitarist John Scofield, with whom he worked closely on the album Star People (1983). In mid-1983, he worked on the tracks for Decoy, an album mixing soul music and electronica that was released in 1984. He brought in producer, composer, and keyboardist Robert Irving III, who had collaborated with him on The Man with the Horn. With a seven-piece band that included Scofield, Evans, Irving, Foster, and Darryl Jones, he played a series of European performances that were positively received. In December 1984, while in Denmark, he was awarded the Léonie Sonning Music Prize. Trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg had written \"Aura\", a contemporary classical piece, for the event which impressed Davis to the point of returning to Denmark in early 1985 to record his next studio album, Aura.[177] Columbia was dissatisfied with the recording and delayed its release.\\nAlso in 1984, Davis met 34-year-old sculptor Jo Gelbard.[178] Gelbard would teach Davis how to paint; the two were frequent collaborators and were soon romantically engaged.[178][179] By 1985, Davis was diabetic and required daily injections of insulin.[180]\\nIn May 1985, one month into a tour, Davis signed a contract with Warner Bros. that required him to give up his publishing rights.[181][182] You\\'re Under Arrest, his final album for Columbia, was released in September. It included cover versions of two pop songs: \"Time After Time\" by Cyndi Lauper and Michael Jackson\\'s \"Human Nature\". He considered releasing an album of pop songs, and he recorded dozens of them, but the idea was rejected. He said that many of today\\'s jazz standards had been pop songs in Broadway theater and that he was simply updating the standards repertoire.\\nDavis collaborated with a number of figures from the British post-punk and new wave movements during this period, including Scritti Politti.[183] This period also saw Davis move from his funk inspired sound of the early 70s to a more melodic style.[34]\\nAfter taking part in the recording of the 1985 protest song \"Sun City\" as a member of Artists United Against Apartheid, Davis appeared on the instrumental \"Don\\'t Stop Me Now\" by Toto for their album Fahrenheit (1986). Davis intended to collaborate with Prince, but the project was dropped.[184] Davis also collaborated with Zane Giles and Randy Hall on the Rubberband sessions in 1985 but those would remain unreleased until 2019.[185] Instead, he worked with Marcus Miller, and Tutu (1986) became the first time he used modern studio tools such as programmed synthesizers, sampling, and drum loops. Released in September 1986, its front cover is a photographic portrait of Davis by Irving Penn.[182] In 1987, he won a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Soloist. Also in 1987, Davis contacted American journalist Quincy Troupe to work with him on his autobiography.[179] The two had met the previous year when Troupe conducted a two-day-long interview.[179] The interview was then published by Spin as a 45-page article.[179]\\nIn 1988, Davis had a small part as a street musician in the Christmas comedy film Scrooged starring Bill Murray. He also collaborated with Zucchero Fornaciari in a version of Dune Mosse (Blue\\'s), published in 2004 in Zu & Co. of the Italian bluesman. In November 1988, he was inducted into the Knights of Malta at a ceremony at the Alhambra Palace in Spain (hence the \"Sir\" title on his gravestone).[186] Later that month, Davis cut his European tour short after he collapsed and fainted after a two-hour show in Madrid and flew home.[187] Rumors of his health were reported by the American magazine Star in its February 21, 1989 edition, which published a claim that Davis had contracted AIDS, prompting his manager Peter Shukat to issue a statement the following day. Shukat said Davis had been in the hospital for a mild case of pneumonia and the removal of a benign polyp on his vocal cords and was resting comfortably in preparation for his 1989 tours.[188] Davis later blamed one of his former wives or girlfriends for starting the rumor and decided against taking legal action.[189] He was interviewed on 60 Minutes by Harry Reasoner. In October 1989, he received a Grande Medaille de Vermeil from Paris mayor Jacques Chirac.[190] In 1990, he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[191] In early 1991, he appeared in the Rolf de Heer film Dingo as a jazz musician.\\nDavis followed Tutu with Amandla (1989) and soundtracks to four films: Street Smart, Siesta, The Hot Spot, and Dingo. His last albums were released posthumously: the hip hop-influenced Doo-Bop (1992) and Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux (1993), a collaboration with Quincy Jones from the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival where, for the first time in three decades, he performed songs from Miles Ahead, Porgy and Bess, and Sketches of Spain.[192]\\nOn July 8, 1991, Davis returned to performing material from his past at the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival with a band and orchestra conducted by Quincy Jones.[193] The set consisted of arrangements from his albums recorded with Gil Evans.[194] The show was followed by a concert billed as \"Miles and Friends\" at the Grande halle de la Villette in Paris two days later, with guest performances by musicians from throughout his career, including John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock, and Joe Zawinul.[194] In Paris, he was awarded the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor.[191] After returning to America, he stopped in New York City to record material for Doo-Bop, then returned to California to play at the Hollywood Bowl on August 25, his final live performance.[193][195]\\nDavis would become increasingly aggressive in his final year due in part to the medication he was taking.[178] His aggression would take the form of violence towards his partner Jo Gelbard.[178]\\nIn early September 1991, Davis checked into St. John\\'s Hospital near his home in Santa Monica, California, for routine tests.[196] Doctors suggested he have a tracheal tube implanted to relieve his breathing after repeated bouts of bronchial pneumonia. The suggestion provoked an outburst from Davis that led to an intracerebral hemorrhage followed by a coma. According to Jo Gelbard, on September 26, Davis painted his final painting, composed of dark, ghostly figures, dripping blood and \"his imminent demise.\"[157] After several days on life support, his machine was turned off and he died on September 28, 1991, in the arms of Gelbard.[197][179] He was 65 years old. His death was attributed to the combined effects of a stroke, pneumonia, and respiratory failure.[10] According to Troupe, Davis was taking azidothymidine (AZT), a type of antiretroviral drug used for the treatment of HIV and AIDS, during his treatments in hospital.[198] A funeral service was held on October 5, 1991, at St. Peter\\'s Lutheran Church on Lexington Avenue in New York City[199][200] that was attended by around 500 friends, family members, and musical acquaintances, with many fans standing in the rain.[201] He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City, with one of his trumpets, near the site of Duke Ellington\\'s grave.[202][201]\\nAt the time of his death, Davis\\' estate was valued at more than $1 million. In his will, Davis left 20 percent to his daughter Cheryl Davis; 40 percent to his son Erin Davis; 10 percent to his nephew Vincent Wilburn Jr. and 15 percent each to his brother Vernon Davis and his sister Dorothy Wilburn. He excluded his two sons Gregory and Miles IV.[203]\\nLate in his life, from the \"electric period\" onwards, Davis repeatedly explained his reasons for not wishing to perform his earlier works, such as Birth of the Cool or Kind of Blue. In his view, remaining stylistically static was the wrong option.[204] He commented: \"\\'So What\\' or Kind of Blue, they were done in that era, the right hour, the right day, and it happened. It\\'s over\\xa0... What I used to play with Bill Evans, all those different modes, and substitute chords, we had the energy then and we liked it. But I have no feel for it anymore, it\\'s more like warmed-over turkey.\"[205] When Shirley Horn insisted in 1990 that Miles reconsider playing the ballads and modal tunes of his Kind of Blue period, he demurred. \"Nah, it hurts my lip,\" was the reason he gave.[205] Bill Evans, who played piano on Kind of Blue, said: \"I would like to hear more of the consummate melodic master, but I feel that big business and his record company have had a corrupting influence on his material. The rock and pop thing certainly draws a wider audience.\"[205] Throughout his later career, Davis declined offers to reinstate his \\'60s quintet.[157]\\nMany books and documentaries focus more extensively on his earlier work, with 1975 typically being the cutoff date.[157] According to an article by The Independent, from 1975 onwards a decline in critical praise for Davis\\' output began to form, with many viewing the era as \"worthless\"\\xa0: \"There is a surprisingly widespread view that, in terms of the merits of his musical output, Davis might as well have died in 1975\".[157] In a 1982 interview in DownBeat, Wynton Marsalis said: \"They call Miles\\'s stuff jazz. That stuff is not jazz, man. Just because somebody played jazz at one time, that doesn\\'t mean they\\'re still playing it.\"[157] Despite his contempt for Davis\\' later work, Marsalis\\' work is \"laden with ironic references to Davis\\' music of the \\'60s.\"[34]  Davis did not necessarily disagree; lambasting what he saw as Marsalis\\'s stylistic conservatism, Davis said \"Jazz is dead... it\\'s finito! It\\'s over and there\\'s no point apeing the shit.\"[206] Writer Stanley Crouch criticised Davis\\' work from \"In a Silent Way onwards.\"[157]\\nMiles Davis is considered one of the most innovative, influential, and respected figures in the history of music. Based on professional rankings of his albums and songs, the aggregate website Acclaimed Music lists him as the 16th most acclaimed recording artist in history.[207] The Guardian described him as \"a pioneer of 20th-century music, leading many of the key developments in the world of jazz.\"[208] He has been called \"one of the great innovators in jazz\",[209] and had the titles Prince of Darkness and the Picasso of Jazz bestowed upon him.[210] The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll said, \"Miles Davis played a crucial and inevitably controversial role in every major development in jazz since the mid-\\'40s, and no other jazz musician has had so profound an effect on rock. Miles Davis was the most widely recognized jazz musician of his era, an outspoken social critic and an arbiter of style—in attitude and fashion—as well as music.\"[211]\\nWilliam Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote, \"To examine his career is to examine the history of jazz from the mid-1940s to the early 1990s, since he was in the thick of almost every important innovation and stylistic development in the music during that period\\xa0... It can even be argued that jazz stopped evolving when Davis wasn\\'t there to push it forward.\"[1] Francis Davis of The Atlantic notes that Davis\\' career can be seen as a critique of the jazz music played time, specifically bebop.[212] Music writer Christopher Smith wrote:\\nMiles Davis\\' artistic interest was in the creation and manipulation of ritual space, in which gestures could be endowed with symbolic power sufficient to form a functional communicative, and hence musical, vocabulary.\\xa0... Miles\\' performance tradition emphasized orality and the transmission of information and artistic insight from individual to individual. His position in that tradition, and his personality, talents, and artistic interests, impelled him to pursue a uniquely individual solution to the problems and the experiential possibilities of improvised performance.His approach, owing largely to the African-American performance tradition that focused on individual expression, emphatic interaction, and creative response to shifting contents, had a profound impact on generations of jazz musicians.[213] Musicians and admirers of Davis work include Carlos Santana, Herbie Hancock, Flea, The Roots, Wayne Shorter.[214] In 2016, digital publication The Pudding in an article examining Davis\\' legacy found that 2,452 Wikipedia pages mention Davis, with over 286 citing him as an influence.[215]\\nKind of Blue remains the best-selling jazz album of all time. On November 5, 2009, U.S. Representative John Conyers of Michigan sponsored a measure in the United States House of Representatives to commemorate the album on its 50th anniversary. The measure also affirms jazz as a national treasure and \"encourages the United States government to preserve and advance the art form of jazz music\".[216] It passed with a vote of 409–0 on December 15, 2009.[217] The trumpet Davis used on the recording is displayed on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. It was donated to the school by Arthur \"Buddy\" Gist, who met Davis in 1949 and became a close friend. The gift was the reason why the jazz program at UNCG is named the Miles Davis Jazz Studies Program.[218]\\nIn 1986, the New England Conservatory awarded Davis an honorary doctorate for his contributions to music.[219] Since 1960 the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) honored him with eight Grammy Awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards.\\nIn 2001, The Miles Davis Story, a two-hour documentary film by Mike Dibb, won an International Emmy Award for arts documentary of the year.[220] Since 2005, the Miles Davis Jazz Committee has held an annual Miles Davis Jazz Festival.[221] Also in 2005, a London exhibition was held of his paintings, The Last Miles: The Music of Miles Davis, 1980-1991\\' was released detailing his final years and eight of his albums from the 1960s and 70s were reissued in celebration of the 50th anniversary of his signing to Columbia Records.[157] In 2006, Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[222] In 2012, the U.S. Postal Service issued commemorative stamps featuring Davis.[222]\\nMiles Ahead was a 2015 American music film directed by Don Cheadle, co-written by Cheadle with Steven Baigelman, Stephen J. Rivele, and Christopher Wilkinson, which interprets the life and compositions of Davis. It premiered at the New York Film Festival in October 2015. The film stars Cheadle, Emayatzy Corinealdi as Frances Taylor, Ewan McGregor, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Lakeith Stanfield.[223] That same year a statue of him was erected in his home city, Alton, Illinois and listeners of BBC Radio and Jazz FM voted Davis the greatest jazz musician.[224][221] Publications such as The Guardian have also ranked Davis amongst the best of all jazz musicians.[225] On May 27, 2016, American pianist and record producer Robert Glasper released a tribute album entitled Everything\\'s Beautiful which features 11 reinterpretations of Davis songs.[226]\\nIn 2018, American rapper Q-Tip played Miles Davis in a theatre production, My Funny Valentine.[227] Q-Tip had previously played Davis in 2010.[227] In 2019, the documentary Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool, directed by Stanley Nelson, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.[228] Birth of the cool was later released on PBS\\' American Masters series.[214]\\nDavis has, however, been subject to criticism. In 1990, writer Stanley Crouch, labelled Davis \"the most brilliant sellout in the history of jazz,\"[157] An 1993 essay by Robert Walser in The Musical Quarterly claims that \"Davis has long been infamous for missing more notes than any other major trumpet player.\"[229] Also in the essay is a quote by music critic James Lincoln Collier who states that \"if his influence was profound, the ultimate value of his work is another matter,\" and calls Davis an \"adequate instrumentalist\" but \"not a great one.\"[229] In 2013, The A.V. Club published an article titled \"Miles Davis beat his wives and made beautiful music,\"[230] In the article, writer Sonia Saraiya praises Davis as a musician, but criticizes him as a person, in particular, his abuse of his wives.[230] Others, such as Francis Davis, have criticized his treatment of women, describing it as \"contemptible\".[212]\\nGrammy Awards\\nOther awards\\n\\n\\n', 'Sun_Ra': 'Le Sony\\'r Ra[3] (born Herman Poole Blount, May 22, 1914 – May 30, 1993), better known as Sun Ra, was an American jazz composer, bandleader, piano and synthesizer player, and poet known for his experimental music, \"cosmic\" philosophy, prolific output, and theatrical performances. For much of his career, Ra led \"The Arkestra,\" an ensemble with an ever-changing name and flexible line-up.\\nBorn and raised in Alabama, Blount became involved in the Chicago jazz scene during the late 1940s. He soon abandoned his birth name, taking the name Le Sony\\'r Ra, shortened to Sun Ra (after Ra, the Egyptian God of the Sun). Claiming to be an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace, he developed a mythical persona and an idiosyncratic credo that made him a pioneer of Afrofuturism.[4] Throughout his life he denied ties to his prior identity saying, \"Any name that I use other than Ra is a pseudonym.\"[5]\\nHis widely eclectic and avant-garde music echoed the entire history of jazz, from ragtime and early New Orleans hot jazz, to swing music, bebop, free jazz and fusion. His compositions ranged from keyboard solos to works for big bands of over 30 musicians, along with electronic excursions, songs, chants, percussion pieces, and anthems. From the mid-1950s until his death, Ra led the musical collective The Arkestra (which featured artists such as Marshall Allen, John Gilmore and June Tyson throughout its various iterations). Its performances often included dancers and musicians dressed in elaborate, futuristic costumes inspired by ancient Egyptian attire and the Space Age. (Following Ra\\'s illness-forced retirement in 1992, the band remained active as The Sun Ra Arkestra, and, as of 2018, continues performing under the leadership of veteran Ra sideman Marshall Allen.)[6]\\nThough his mainstream success was limited, Sun Ra was a prolific recording artist and frequent live performer, and remained influential throughout his life for his music and persona.[7] He is now widely considered an innovator; among his distinctions are his pioneering work in free improvisation and modal jazz and his early use of electronic keyboards and synthesizers.[7][8] Over the course of his career, he recorded dozens of singles and over one hundred full-length albums, comprising well over 1,000 songs, making him one of the most prolific recording artists of the 20th century.[9]\\nHe was born Herman Blount on May 22, 1914, in Birmingham, Alabama, as discovered by his biographer, John F. Szwed, and published in his 1998 book.[10] He was named after the popular vaudeville stage magician Black Herman, who had deeply impressed his mother.[10] He was nicknamed \"Sonny\" from his childhood, had an older sister and half-brother, and was doted upon by his mother and grandmother.\\nFor decades, very little was known about Sun Ra\\'s early life, and he contributed to its mystique. As a self-invented person, he routinely gave evasive, contradictory or seemingly nonsensical answers to personal questions, and denied his birth name.[10] He speculated, only half in jest, that he was distantly related to Elijah Poole, later known as Elijah Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam.[10][11] His birthday for years remained unknown, as his claims ranged from 1910 to 1918. Only a few years before his death, the date of Sun Ra\\'s birth was still a mystery. Jim Macnie\\'s notes for Blue Delight (1989) said that Sun Ra was believed to be about 75\\xa0years old. But Szwed was able to uncover a wealth of information about his early life and confirmed a birth date of May 22, 1914.\\nAs a child, Blount was a skilled pianist. By the age of 11 or 12, he was composing[12] and sight reading music. Birmingham was an important stop for touring musicians and he saw prominent musicians such as Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, and Fats Waller, and others now forgotten. Sun Ra once said, \"The world let down a lot of good musicians\".[13]\\nIn his teenage years, Blount demonstrated prodigious musical talent: many times, according to acquaintances, he went to big band performances and then produced full transcriptions of the bands\\' songs from memory. By his mid-teens, Blount was performing semi-professionally as a solo pianist, or as a member of various ad hoc jazz and R&B groups. He attended Birmingham\\'s segregated Industrial High School (now known as Parker High School), where he studied under music teacher John T. \"Fess\" Whatley, a demanding disciplinarian who was widely respected and whose classes produced many professional musicians.\\nThough deeply religious, his family was not formally associated with any Christian church or sect. Blount had few or no close friends in high school but was remembered as kind-natured and quiet, an honor roll student, and a voracious reader. He took advantage of the Black Masonic Lodge as one of the few places in Birmingham where African Americans had unlimited access to books. Its collection on Freemasonry and other esoteric concepts made a strong impression on him.[14]\\nBy his teens, Blount suffered from cryptorchidism.[15] It left him with a nearly constant discomfort that sometimes flared into severe pain.[10] Szwed suggests that Blount felt shame about it and the condition contributed to his isolation.[10]\\nIn 1934, Blount was offered his first full-time musical job by Ethel Harper, his biology teacher from the high school, who had organized a band to pursue a career as a singer. Blount joined a musicians\\' trade union and toured with Harper\\'s group through the US Southeast and Midwest. When Harper left the group mid-tour to move to New York (she later was a member of the modestly successful singing group the Ginger Snaps), Blount took over leadership of the group, renaming it the Sonny Blount Orchestra. They continued touring for several months before dissolving as unprofitable. Though the first edition of the Sonny Blount Orchestra was not financially successful, they earned positive notice from fans and other musicians. Blount afterward found steady employment as a musician in Birmingham.\\nBirmingham clubs often featured exotic trappings, such as vivid lighting and murals with tropical or oasis scenes. Some believe these influenced the elements Sun Ra incorporated in his later stage shows. Playing for the big bands gave black musicians a sense of pride and togetherness, and they were highly regarded in the black community. They were expected to be disciplined and presentable, and in the segregated South, black musicians had wide acceptance in white society. They often played for elite white society audiences (though they were typically forbidden from associating with the audience).\\nIn 1936, Whatley\\'s intercession led to Blount\\'s being awarded a scholarship at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University. He was a music education major, studying composition, orchestration, and music theory. He dropped out after a year.\\nSun Ra soon left college because, he claimed, he had a visionary experience as a college student that had a major, long-term influence on him. In 1936 or 1937, in the midst of deep religious concentration, Sun Ra claimed that a bright light appeared around him, and, as he later said:\\nMy whole body changed into something else. I could see through myself. And I went up...  I wasn\\'t in human form... I landed on a planet that I identified as Saturn... they teleported me and I was down on [a] stage with them. They wanted to talk with me. They had one little antenna on each ear. A little antenna over each eye. They talked to me. They told me to stop [attending college] because there was going to be great trouble in schools... the world was going into complete chaos... I would speak [through music], and the world would listen. That\\'s what they told me.[16]Sun Ra said that this experience occurred in 1936 or 1937. According to Szwed, the musician\\'s closest associates cannot date the story any earlier than 1952. (Sun Ra also said that the incident happened when he was living in Chicago, where he did not settle until the late 1940s). Sun Ra discussed the vision, with no substantive variation, to the end of his life. His trip to Saturn allegedly occurred a full decade before flying saucers entered public consciousness with the 1947 encounter of Kenneth Arnold. It was earlier than other public accounts: about 15\\xa0years before George Adamski wrote about contact with benevolent beings; and almost 20\\xa0years before the 1961 case of Barney and Betty Hill, who recounted sinister UFO abductions. Szwed says that, \"even if this story is revisionist autobiography... Sonny was pulling together several strains of his life. He was both prophesizing his future and explaining his past with a single act of personal mythology.\"[17]\\nAfter leaving college, Blount became known as the most singularly devoted musician in Birmingham. He rarely slept, citing Thomas Edison, Leonardo da Vinci, and Napoleon as fellow highly productive cat-nappers. He transformed the first floor of his family\\'s home into a conservatory-workshop, where he wrote songs, transcribed recordings, rehearsed with the many musicians who drifted in and out, and discussed Biblical and esoteric concepts with whomever was interested.[18]\\nBlount became a regular at Birmingham\\'s Forbes Piano Company, a white-owned company. Blount visited the Forbes building almost daily to play music, swap ideas with staff and customers, or copy sheet music into his notebooks.[19] He formed a new band, and like his old teacher Whatley, insisted on rigorous daily rehearsals. The new Sonny Blount Orchestra earned a reputation as an impressive, disciplined band that could play in a wide variety of styles with equal skill.\\nIn October 1942, Blount received a selective service notification that he had been drafted into the Military of the United States. He quickly declared himself a conscientious objector, citing religious objections to war and killing, his financial support of his great-aunt Ida, and his chronic hernia. The local draft board rejected his claim. In an appeal to the national draft board, Blount wrote that the lack of black men on the draft appeal board \"smacks of Hitlerism.\"[20] Sonny\\'s refusal to join the military deeply embarrassed his family, and many relatives ostracized him. He was eventually approved for alternate service at Civilian Public Service camp in Pennsylvania, but he did not appear at the camp as required on December 8, 1942. Shortly after, he was arrested in Alabama.\\nIn court, Blount said that alternate service was unacceptable; he debated the judge on points of law and Biblical interpretation. The judge ruled that Blount was violating the law and was at risk for being drafted into the U.S. military. Blount responded that if inducted, he would use military weapons and training to kill the first high-ranking military officer possible. The judge sentenced Blount to jail (pending draft board and CPS rulings), and then said, \"I\\'ve never seen a nigger like you before.\" Blount replied, \"No, and you never will again.\"[21]\\nIn January 1943, Blount wrote to the United States Marshals Service from the Walker County, Alabama jail in Jasper. He said he was facing a nervous breakdown from the stress of imprisonment, that he was suicidal, and that he was in constant fear of sexual assault. When his conscientious objector status was reaffirmed in February 1943, he was escorted to Pennsylvania. He did forestry work as assigned during the day and was allowed to play piano at night. Psychiatrists there described him as \"a psychopathic personality [and] sexually perverted,\" but also as \"a well-educated colored intellectual.\"[22]\\nIn March 1943, the draft board reclassified Blount as 4-F because of his hernia, and he returned to Birmingham, embittered and angered. He formed a new band and soon was playing professionally. After his beloved great-aunt Ida died in 1945, Blount felt no reason to stay in Birmingham. He dissolved the band, and moved to Chicago—part of the Second Great Migration, southern African Americans who moved north during and after World War II.\\nIn Chicago, Blount quickly found work, notably with blues singer Wynonie Harris, with whom he made his recording debut on two 1946 singles, Dig This Boogie/Lightning Struck the Poorhouse,[23] and My Baby\\'s Barrelhouse/Drinking By Myself. Dig This Boogie was also Blount\\'s first recorded piano solo. He performed with the locally successful Lil Green band and played bump-and-grind music for months in Calumet City strip clubs.\\nIn August 1946, Blount earned a lengthy engagement at the Club DeLisa under bandleader and composer Fletcher Henderson. Blount had long admired Henderson, but Henderson\\'s fortunes had declined (his band was now made of up middling musicians rather than the stars of earlier years) in large part because of his instability, due to Henderson\\'s long term injuries from a car accident. Henderson hired Blount as pianist and arranger, replacing Marl Young. Ra\\'s arrangements initially showed a degree of bebop influence, but the band members resisted the new music, despite Henderson\\'s encouragement.\\nIn 1948, Blount performed briefly in a trio with saxophonist Coleman Hawkins and violinist Stuff Smith, both preeminent musicians. There are no known recordings of this trio, but a home recording of a Blount-Smith duet from 1953 appears on Sound Sun Pleasure, and one of Sun Ra\\'s final recordings in 1992 was a rare sideman appearance on violinist Billy Bang\\'s Tribute to Stuff Smith.\\nIn addition to enabling professional advancement, what he encountered in Chicago changed Blount\\'s personal outlook. The city was a center of African-American political activism and fringe movements, with Black Muslims, Black Hebrews, and others proselytizing, debating, and printing leaflets or books. Blount absorbed it all and was fascinated with the city\\'s many ancient Egyptian-styled buildings and monuments. He read books such as George G.M. James\\'s Stolen Legacy (which argued that classical Greek philosophy had its roots in ancient Egypt). Blount concluded that the accomplishments and history of Africans had been systematically suppressed and denied by European cultures.\\nBy 1952, Blount was leading the Space Trio with drummer Tommy \"Bugs\" Hunter and saxophonist Pat Patrick, two of the most accomplished musicians he had known. They performed regularly, and Sun Ra began writing more advanced songs.[24]\\nOn October 20, 1952, Blount legally changed his name to Le Sony\\'r Ra. Sun Ra claimed[25] to have always been uncomfortable with his birth name of Blount. He considered it a slave name, from a family that was not his. David Martinelli suggested that his change was similar to \"Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali... [dropping] their slave names in the process of attaining a new self-awareness and self-esteem\".[26]\\nPatrick left the group to move to Florida with his new wife. His friend John Gilmore (tenor sax) joined the group, and Marshall Allen (alto sax) soon followed. Patrick was in and out of the group until the end of his life, but Allen and Gilmore were the two most devoted members of the Arkestra. In fact, Gilmore is often criticized for staying with Sun Ra for over forty years when he could have been a strong leader in his own right.[27] Saxophonist James Spaulding and trombonist Julian Priester also recorded with Sun Ra in Chicago, and both went on to careers of their own. The Chicago tenor Von Freeman also did a short stint with the band of the early 1950s.[28]\\nIn Chicago, Sun Ra met Alton Abraham, a precociously intelligent teenager and something of a kindred spirit. He became the Arkestra\\'s biggest booster and one of Sun Ra\\'s closest friends. Both men felt like outsiders and shared an interest in esoterica. Abraham\\'s strengths balanced Ra\\'s shortcomings: though he was a disciplined bandleader, Sun Ra was somewhat introverted and lacked business sense (a trait that haunted his entire career). Abraham was outgoing, well-connected, and practical. Though still a teenager, Abraham eventually became Sun Ra\\'s de facto business manager: he booked performances, suggested musicians for the Arkestra, and introduced several popular songs into the group\\'s repertoire. Ra, Abraham and others formed a sort of book club to trade ideas and discuss the offbeat topics that so intrigued them. This group printed a number of pamphlets and broadsides explaining their conclusions and ideas. Some of these were collected by critic John Corbett and Anthony Elms as The Wisdom of Sun Ra: Sun Ra\\'s Polemical Broadsheets and Streetcorner Leaflets (2006).\\nIn the mid-1950s, Sun Ra and Abraham formed an independent record label that was generally known as El Saturn Records. (It had several name variations.) Initially focused on 45 rpm singles by Sun Ra and artists related to him, Saturn Records issued two full-length albums during the 1950s: Super-Sonic Jazz (1957) and Jazz In Silhouette (1959). Producer Tom Wilson was the first to release a Sun Ra album, through his independent label Transition Records in 1957, entitled Jazz by Sun Ra.[29] During this era, Sun Ra recorded the first of dozens of singles as a band-for-hire backing a range of doo wop and R&B singers; several dozen of these were reissued in a two-CD set, The Singles, by Evidence Records.\\nIn the late 1950s, Sun Ra and his band began to wear outlandish, Egyptian-styled or science fiction-themed costumes and headdresses. These costumes had multiple purposes: they expressed Sun Ra\\'s fascination with ancient Egypt and the space age, they provided a recognizable uniform for the Arkestra, they provided a new identity for the band onstage, and comic relief. (Sun Ra thought avant garde musicians typically took themselves far too seriously.)\\nSun Ra and the Arkestra moved to New York City in the fall of 1961. To save money, Sun Ra and his band members lived communally. This enabled Sun Ra to request rehearsals spontaneously and at any time, which was his established habit. It was during this time in New York that Sun Ra recorded the album The Futuristic Sound of Sun Ra.[27]\\nIn March 1966, the Arkestra secured a regular Monday night gig at Slug\\'s Saloon. This was a breakthrough to new audiences and recognition. Sun Ra\\'s popularity reached an early peak during this period, as the beat generation and early followers of psychedelia embraced him. Regularly for the next year and a half (and intermittently for another half-decade afterwards), Sun Ra and company performed at Slug\\'s for audiences that eventually came to include music critics and leading jazz musicians. Opinions of Sun Ra\\'s music were divided (and hecklers were not uncommon).\\nHigh praise, however, came from two of the architects of bebop. Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie offered encouragement, once stating, \"Keep it up, Sonny, they tried to do the same shit to me,\"[30] and pianist Thelonious Monk chided someone who said Sun Ra was \"too far out\" by responding, \"Yeah, but it swings.\"[31]\\nAlso in 1966, Sun Ra, with members of the Arkestra and Al Kooper\\'s Blues Project, recorded the album Batman and Robin under the pseudonym, The Sensational Guitars of Dan and Dale. The album consisted primarily of instrumental variations on the Batman Theme and public domain classical music, with an uncredited female vocalist singing the \"Robin Theme.\"[32][33]\\nDespite their planned management of money, the costs of New York eventually became too high and motivated the group to move to Philadelphia.\\nIn 1968, when the New York building they were renting was put up for sale, Sun Ra and the Arkestra relocated to the Germantown section of Philadelphia. Sun Ra moved into a house on Morton Street that became the Arkestra\\'s base of operations until his death. Apart from occasional complaints about the noise of rehearsals, they were soon regarded as good neighbors because of their friendliness, drug-free living, and rapport with youngsters. The saxophonist Danny Ray Thompson owned and operated the Pharaoh\\'s Den, a convenience store in the neighborhood. When lightning struck a tree on their street, Sun Ra took it as a good omen. James Jacson fashioned the Cosmic Infinity Drum from the scorched tree trunk. They commuted via railroad to New York for the Monday night gig at Slug\\'s and for other engagements.\\nSun Ra became a fixture in Philadelphia, appearing semi-regularly on WXPN radio, giving lectures to community groups, or visiting the city\\'s libraries. In the mid-1970s, the Arkestra sometimes played free Saturday afternoon concerts in a Germantown park near their home. At their mid-1970s shows in Philadelphia nightclubs, someone stood at the back of the room, selling stacks of unmarked LPs in plain white sleeves, pressed from recordings of the band\\'s live performances.\\nIn late 1968, Sun Ra and the Arkestra made their first tour of the US West Coast. Reactions were mixed. Hippies accustomed to long-form psychedelia like the Grateful Dead were often bewildered by the Arkestra. By this time, the performance included 20–30\\xa0musicians, dancers, singers, fire-eaters, and elaborate lighting. John Burks of Rolling Stone wrote a positive review of a San Jose State College concert. Sun Ra was featured on the April 19, 1969 cover of Rolling Stone magazine, which introduced his inscrutable gaze to millions. During this tour, Damon Choice, then an art student at San Jose, joined the Arkestra and became its vibraphonist.\\nStarting with concerts in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom in 1970, the Arkestra began to tour internationally. They played to audiences who had known his music only through records. Sun Ra continued playing in Europe almost to the end of his life. The saxophonist Danny Ray Thompson became a de facto tour and business manager during this era, specializing in what he called \"no bullshit C.O.D.,\"[34] preferring to take cash before performing or delivering records.\\nIn early 1971, Sun Ra was appointed as artist-in-residence at University of California, Berkeley, teaching a course called The Black Man In the Cosmos.[35] Few students enrolled, but his classes were often full of curious people from the surrounding community. One half-hour of each class was devoted to a lecture (complete with handouts and homework assignments), the other half-hour to an Arkestra performance or Sun Ra keyboard solo. Reading lists included the works of Madame Blavatsky and Henry Dumas, the Tibetan Book of the Dead, Alexander Hislop\\'s The Two Babylons, The Book of Oahspe, and assorted volumes concerning Egyptian hieroglyphs, African American folklore, and other topics.\\nIn 1971, Sun Ra traveled throughout Egypt with the Arkestra at the invitation of the drummer Salah Ragab. He returned to Egypt in 1983 and 1984, when he recorded with Ragab. Recordings made in Egypt were released as Live in Egypt, Nidhamu, Sun Ra Meets Salah Ragab, Egypt Strut and Horizon.[36][37][38]\\nIn 1972, San Francisco public TV station KQED producer John Coney, producer Jim Newman, and screenwriter Joshua Smith worked with Sun Ra to produce an 85-minute feature film, entitled Space Is the Place, with Sun Ra\\'s Arkestra and an ensemble of actors assembled by the production team. It was filmed in Oakland and San Francisco. A 1975 show concert by the Arkestra in Cleveland featured an early lineup of Devo as the opening act. On May 20, 1978, Sun Ra and the Arkestra appeared on the TV show Saturday Night Live.\\nIn New York City in the fall of 1979, Sun Ra and the Arkestra played as the \"house band\" at the Squat Theatre on 23rd Street, which was the performance venue of the avant-garde Hungarian theater troupe. Janos, their manager, transformed the theater into a nightclub while most of the troupe was away that season performing in Europe. Debbie Harry, The Velvet Underground\\'s John Cale and Nico (from Andy Warhol\\'s Factory days), John Lurie and The Lounge Lizards, and other pop and avant-garde musicians were regulars. Sun Ra was disciplined and drank only club soda at the gigs, but did not impose his strict code on his musicians. They respected his discipline and authority. Soft-spoken and charismatic, Sun Ra turned Squat Theater into a universe of big band \"space\" jazz backed by a floor show of sexy Jupiterettes. He directed while playing three synthesizers at the same time. In those days, \"Space Is The Place\" was the space at Squat.\\nThe Arkestra continued their touring and recording through the 1980s and into the 1990s.\\nSun Ra had a stroke in 1990, but kept composing, performing, and leading the Arkestra. Late in his career, he opened a few concerts for the New York–based rock group Sonic Youth. When too ill to perform and tour, Sun Ra appointed Gilmore to lead the Arkestra. (Gilmore was frail from emphysema; after his death in 1995, Allen took over leadership of the Arkestra.)\\nIn late 1992, Sun Ra returned to his birth city of Birmingham to live with his older sister, Mary Jenkins, who (along with various Blount cousins) became his caretaker. In January, he was admitted to Princeton Baptist Medical Center, suffering from congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, strokes, circulatory problems, and other serious maladies.[39] He died in the hospital on May 30, 1993, and was buried at the Elmwood Cemetery. The footstone reads \"Herman Sonny Blount aka Le Sony\\'r Ra\".[40]\\nFollowing Sun Ra\\'s death, the Arkestra was led by tenor saxophonist John Gilmore and later performed under the direction of alto saxophonist Marshall Allen. A 1999 album led by Allen, Song for the Sun, featured Jimmy Hopps and Dick Griffin. In the summer of 2004 the Arkestra became the first American jazz band to perform in Tuva, in southern Siberia, where they played five sets at the Ustuu-Huree Festival.[41]\\nAs of July 2019, the Arkestra continues to tour and perform. In September 2008 they played for 7 days in a row at the ZXZW festival, each day emphasizing different aspects of the musical legacy of Sun Ra. In 2009, they performed at Philadelphia\\'s Institute of Contemporary Art in conjunction with an exhibition that explored the intersection of the Arkestra\\'s performing legacy and the practice of contemporary art.[42] In 2011, they ventured to Australia for the first time, for the 2011 Melbourne International Jazz Festival and MONA (Museum of Old and New Art) in Tasmania. In 2017, the Arkestra performed at the 31st Lowell Folk Festival in Lowell Massachusetts.[43] In 2019, it was announced that the Arkestra would perform at Portland, Oregon\\'s  Hollywood Theater for three nights on July 14, 15, and 16.[44]\\nSun Ra\\'s piano technique touched on many styles: his youthful fascination with boogie woogie, stride piano and blues, a sometimes refined touch reminiscent of Count Basie or Ahmad Jamal, and angular phrases in the style of Thelonious Monk or brutal, percussive attacks like Cecil Taylor. Often overlooked is the range of influences from classical music – Sun Ra cited Chopin, Rachmaninoff, Schoenberg and Shostakovich as his favorite composers for the piano.[45]\\nSun Ra\\'s music can be roughly divided into three phases, but his records and performances were full of surprises and the following categories should be regarded only as approximations.\\nThe first period occurred in the 1950s when Sun Ra\\'s music evolved from big band swing into the outer-space-themed \"cosmic jazz\" for which he was best known. Music critics and jazz historians say some of his best work was recorded during this period and it is also some of his most accessible music. Sun Ra\\'s music in this era was often tightly arranged and sometimes reminiscent of Duke Ellington\\'s, Count Basie\\'s, or other important swing music ensembles. However, there was a strong influence from post-swing styles like bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz, and touches of the exotic and hints of the experimentalism that dominated his later music. Notable Sun Ra albums from the 1950s include Sun Ra Visits Planet Earth, Interstellar Low Ways, Super-Sonic Jazz, We Travel the Space Ways, The Nubians of Plutonia and Jazz In Silhouette.\\nRonnie Boykins, Sun Ra\\'s bassist, has been described as \"the pivot around which much of Sun Ra\\'s music revolved for eight years.\" This is especially pronounced on the key recordings from 1965 (The Magic City, The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, Volume One, and The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, Volume Two) where the intertwining lines of Boykins\\' bass and Ra\\'s electronic keyboards provide cohesion.[citation needed]\\nAfter the move to New York, Sun Ra and company plunged headlong into the experimentalism that they had only hinted at in Chicago. The music was often extremely loud and the Arkestra grew to include multiple drummers and percussionists. In recordings of this era, Ra began to use new technologies—such as extensive use of tape delay—to assemble spatial sound pieces that were far removed from earlier compositions such as Saturn. Recordings and live performances often featured passages for unusual instrumental combinations, and passages of collective playing that incorporated free improvisation. It is often difficult to tell where compositions end and improvisations begin.\\nIn this era, Sun Ra began conducting using hand and body gestures. This system inspired cornetist Butch Morris, who later developed his own more highly refined way to conduct improvisers.\\nThough often associated with avant-garde jazz, Sun Ra did not believe his work could be classified as \"free music\": \"I have to make sure that every note, every nuance, is correct... If you want to call it that, spell it p-h-r-e, because ph is a definite article and re is the name of the sun. So I play phre music – music of the sun.\"[46]\\nSeeking to broaden his compositional possibilities, Sun Ra insisted all band members double on various percussion instruments – predating world music by drawing on various ethnic musical forms – and most saxophonists became multireedists, adding instruments such as flutes, oboes, or clarinets to their arsenals. In this era, Sun Ra was among the first of any musicians to make extensive and pioneering use of synthesizers and other various electronic keyboards; he was given a prototype Minimoog by its inventor, Robert Moog. According to the Bob Moog Foundation: \"Sun Ra first met Robert Moog after Downbeat journalist and Sun Ra acquaintance Tam Fiofori arranged for a visit to Moog’s factory in Trumansburg in the Fall of 1969....it was during this visit that Moog loaned Sun Ra a prototype Minimoog (Model B), several months before the commercial instrument (Model D) was introduced in March 1970. Ra immediately added the instrument to his repertoire of keyboards, later acquired a second, and featured the Minimoog prominently on many of his recordings of the early 1970s.\"[47][48]\\nNotable titles from this period include The Magic City, Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy, When Sun Comes Out, The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, Volume One, Atlantis, Secrets of the Sun and Other Planes of There.\\nDuring their third period, beginning in the 1970s, Sun Ra and the Arkestra settled down into a relatively conventional sound, often incorporating swing standards, although their records and concerts were still highly eclectic and energetic, and typically included at least one lengthy, semi-improvised percussion jam. Sun Ra was explicitly asserting a continuity with the ignored jazz tradition: \"They tried to fool you, now I got to school you, about jazz, about jazz\" he chanted in concerts,[49] framing the inclusion of pieces by Fletcher Henderson and Jelly Roll Morton.[citation needed]\\nIn the 1970s Sun Ra took a liking to the films of Walt Disney. He incorporated smatterings of Disney musical numbers into many of his performances from then on. In the late 1980s the Arkestra performed a concert at Walt Disney World. The Arkestra\\'s version of \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" is available on Stay Awake, a tribute album of Disney tunes played by various artists and produced by Hal Willner. A number of Sun Ra\\'s 1970s concerts are available on CD, but none have received a wide release in comparison to his earlier music. In 1978–80 performances, Sun Ra added a large electronic creation, the Outerspace Visual Communicator, which produced images rather than sounds; this was performed at a keyboard by its inventor, Bill Sebastian. During concerts, the OVC usually was positioned at center stage behind the Arkestra while Sebastian sat on stage with the musicians.\\nDozens of musicians—perhaps hundreds—passed through Sun Ra\\'s bands over the years. Some stayed with him for decades, while others played on only a few recordings or performances.\\nSun Ra was personally responsible for the vast majority of the constant changes in the Arkestra\\'s lineup. According to contrabassist Jiunie Booth, a member of the Arkestra, Sun Ra did not confront any musician whose performance he was unsatisfied with. Instead, he would simply gather the entire Arkestra minus the offending musician, and skip town—leaving the fired musician stranded. \\nThe following is a partial list of musical collaborators, and the eras when they played with Sun Ra or the Arkestra:\\n\\n\\nThe Outer Space Visual Communicator was a giant machine that was played with hands and feet to create light designs, similar to how musicians create and sound with their instruments. The name of the instrument arose from Bill Sebastian\\'s collaboration with Sun Ra, who incorporated the OVC into the Arkestra from 1978–1980 and experimented on video applications from 1981 to 1987.[52][53]\\n\\nSun Ra\\'s world view was often described as a philosophy, but he rejected this term, describing his own manner as an \"equation\" and saying that while philosophy was based on theories and abstract reasoning, his method was based on logic and pragmatism. Many of the Arkestra cite Sun Ra\\'s teachings as pivotal and for inspiring such long-term devotion to the music that they knew would never make them much money. His equation was rarely (if ever) explained as a whole; instead, it was related in bits and pieces over many years, leading some to doubt that he had a coherent message. However, Martinelli argues that, when considered as a whole, one can discern a unified world view that draws upon many sources, but is also unique to Sun Ra, writing:Sun Ra presents a unified conception, incorporating music, myth, and performance into his multi-leveled equations. Every aspect of the Sun Ra experience, from business practices like Saturn Records to published collections of poetry to his 35-year career in music, is a manifestation of his equations. Sun Ra seeks to elevate humanity beyond their current earthbound state, tied to outmoded conceptions of life and death when the potential future of immortality awaits them. As Hall has put it, \\'In this era of \\'practical\\' things men ridicule even the existence of God. They scoff at goodness while they ponder with befuddled minds the phantasmagoria of materiality. They have forgotten the path which leads beyond the stars.\\'[26]He drew on sources as diverse as the Kabbalah, Rosicrucianism, channeling, numerology, Freemasonry, Ancient Egyptian Mysticism, and Black nationalism. Sun Ra\\'s system had distinct Gnostic leanings,[54] arguing that the god of most monotheistic religions was not the creator god, not the ultimate god, but a lesser, evil being. Sun Ra was wary of the Bible, knowing that it had been used to justify slavery. He often re-arranged and re-worded Biblical passages (and re-worked many other words, names, or phrases) in an attempt to uncover \"hidden\" meanings. The most obvious evidence of this system was Ra\\'s practice of renaming many of the musicians who played with him.\\nBassoonist/multireedist James Jacson had studied Zen Buddhism before joining Sun Ra and identified strong similarities between Zen teachings and practices (particularly Zen koans) and Ra\\'s use of non sequiturs and seemingly absurd replies to questions.[55] Drummer Art Jenkins admitted that Sun Ra\\'s \"nonsense\" sometimes troubled his thoughts for days until inspiring a sort of paradigm shift, or profound change in outlook.[56] Drummer Andrew Cyrille said Sun Ra\\'s comments were \"very interesting stuff... whether you believed it or not. And a lot of times it was humorous, and a lot of times it was ridiculous, and a lot of times it was right on the money.\"[57]\\nAccording to Szwed,[58] Sun Ra\\'s view of his relationship to black people and black cultures \"changed drastically\" over time. Initially, Sun Ra identified closely with broader struggles for black power, black political influence, and black identity, and saw his own music as a key element in educating and liberating blacks. But by the heyday of Black Power radicalism in the 1960s, Sun Ra was expressing disillusionment with these aims. He denied feeling closely connected to any race. In 1970 he said:\\nI couldn\\'t approach black people with the truth because they like lies. They live lies... At one time I felt that white people were to blame for everything, but then I found out that they were just puppets and pawns of some greater force, which has been using them... Some force is having a good time [manipulating black and white people] and looking, enjoying itself up in a reserved seat, wondering, \"I wonder when they\\'re going to wake up.\"[59]Sun Ra is considered to be an early pioneer of the Afrofuturism movement due to his music, writings and other works.[60]\\nThe influence of Sun Ra can be seen throughout many aspects of black music. He grounded his practice of Afrofuturism in a musical tradition of performing blackness that remains relevant today. Sun Ra lived out his beliefs of Afrofuturism in his daily life by embodying the movement not only in his music, but also in his clothes and actions. This embodiment of the narrative allowed him to demonstrate black nationalism as a counternarrative to the present culture.\\nIt was in Chicago, as well, in the mid-fifties, that Ra began experimenting with extraterrestriality in his stage show, sometimes playing regular cocktail lounges dressed in space suits and ancient Egyptian regalia. By placing his band and performances in space and extraterrestrial environments Sun Ra built a world that was his own view of how the African diaspora connected.[61]\\nMany of Sun Ra\\'s innovations remain important and groundbreaking. Ra was one of the first jazz leaders to use two double basses, to employ the electric bass, to play electronic keyboards, to use extensive percussion and polyrhythms, to explore modal music and to pioneer solo and group freeform improvisations. In addition, he made his mark in the wider cultural context: he proclaimed the African origins of jazz, reaffirmed pride in black history and reasserted the spiritual and mystical dimensions of music, all important factors in the black cultural/political renaissance of the 1960s.[citation needed]\\nNRBQ recorded \"Rocket #9\" in 1968 for their debut album on Columbia. Sun Ra had given NRBQ\\'s Terry Adams a copy of the song on 45 and told him, \"This is especially for you,\" which Adams reported inspired him to reform the band after a period of inactivity. The band still includes Sun Ra\\'s compositions in their performances, and besides \"Rocket #9\" have released recordings of \"We Travel the Spaceways\" and \"Love in Outer Space.\"  Several members of the Arkestra have toured with NRBQ over the years, including Pat Patrick, Marshall Allen, Knoel Scott, Tyrone Hill and Danny Thompson.  Adams has joined the Arkestra as their pianist on several tours, most recently during a February 2016 tour of cities in the US southeast.\\nDetroit\\'s MC5 played a handful of shows with Sun Ra and were influenced by his works immensely. One of their songs from their premiere album Kick Out the Jams featured a track called Starship, which was based on a poem by Ra.[citation needed][62]\\nSun Ra was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame in 1979.\\nThe Sun Ra Repatriation Project was started in 2008 with the aim of using interplanetary communication with a view to facilitating Sun Ra\\'s return to planet Earth.[63]\\nFilmmaker and visual artist Cauleen Smith has heavily researched the life and legacy of Sun Ra. Her 2013 exhibition \"17\" \"arises out of [her] research into the legacy of Sun Ra, who was himself a student of numerology and achieved a kind of cultural immortality the number 17 might be said to refer to\".[64] Her project \"The Solar Flare Arkestral Marching Band\" includes several components related to Sun Ra. \"One component (2010) of the project is the production of five flash mob street performances involving a marching band inspired by Sun Ra\\'s Arkestra. The second component of the project... is a full-length video that chronicles the urban legends of Sun Ra’s time in Chicago as well as the contemporary artists who live and work in this city\".[65]\\nThe \"Sun Ra Revival Post-Krautrock Archestra\",[66] formed in Australia during 2014, paid tribute to Sun Ra\\'s philosophies and musical ideas within their albums Realm Beyond Realm and Sun Ra Kills the World.[67]\\nThe Spatial AKA Orchestra, formed in 2006 by Jerry Dammers (the main songwriter of British ska revival band The Specials), was originally created as a tribute to Sun Ra, borrowing many of the ideas, themes and tropes from Sun Ra\\'s own performances.\\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Sun Ra among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[68]\\nThe University of Chicago has an extensive collection of Sun Ra\\'s works and personal items in the Special Collections Research Center at the Regenstein Library. The collection was assembled by Ra\\'s business manager Alton Abraham and is open to the public upon request. The Special Collections Research Center has also repeatedly exhibited Sun Ra\\'s work.\\nSpace Is the Place (1974) is a feature-length film that stars Sun Ra and his band as themselves. The soundtrack, also by Sun Ra, is available on CD. The film follows Sun Ra after he returns to Chicago from many years of space travel with his Arkestra. In a meeting with \"the Overseer\" – a devil-like figure stationed in the desert – Sun Ra agrees to play a game of cards to \"win\" the black community. Sun Ra\\'s goal is to transport the American black community to a new planet he discovered while on his journey, and that he hopes to use as a home for an entirely black population. The artist\\'s mission is to \"teleport the whole planet through music\", but his attempts are often misunderstood by his supposed converts.[citation needed]\\nSun Ra and his Arkestra were the subject of a few documentary films, including Robert Mugge\\'s Sun Ra: A Joyful Noise (1980). It interspersed passages of performances and rehearsals with Sun Ra\\'s commentary on various subjects ranging from today\\'s youth to his own place in the cosmos. More recently, Don Letts\\' Sun Ra – Brother from Another Planet (2005) incorporated some of Mugge\\'s material, and includes some additional interviews. Points on a Space Age (2009) is a documentary by Ephrahaim Asili.[69][70] \"It\\'s a 60-minute doc along the lines of the talking-head-intercut-with performance clips style.\"[69]\\nSun Ra wrote an enormous number of songs and material regarding his spiritual beliefs and music. A magazine titled Sun Ra Research was published irregularly for many years, providing extensive documentation of Sun Ra\\'s perspectives on many issues. Sun Ra\\'s collected poetry and prose is available as a book, published May 2005, entitled Sun Ra, The Immeasurable Equation.[71] Another book of over 260 of Sun Ra\\'s poems, Sun Ra: Collected Works Vol. 1: Immeasurable Equation was published by Phaelos Books in November 2005. The Wisdom of Sun Ra: Sun Ra\\'s Polemical Broadsheets and Streetcorner Leaflets, was published in book form in 2005, by WhiteWalls. A collection of Sun Ra\\'s poetry, This Planet Is Doomed, was published by Kicks Books in 2011.\\n\\n', 'Nina_Simone': '\\nEunice Kathleen Waymon (February 21, 1933\\xa0– April 21, 2003), known professionally as Nina Simone, was an American singer, songwriter, musician, arranger, and civil rights activist. Her music spanned a broad range of musical styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop.\\nThe sixth of eight children born to a poor family in Tryon, North Carolina, Simone initially aspired to be a concert pianist.[1] With the help of a few supporters in her hometown, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York City.[2] She then applied for a scholarship to study at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied admission despite a well-received audition,[3] which she attributed to racial discrimination. In 2003, just days before her death, the Institute awarded her an honorary degree.[4]\\nTo make a living, Simone started playing piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She changed her name to \"Nina Simone\" to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play \"the devil\\'s music\"[3] or so-called \"cocktail piano\". She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, which effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist.[5] She went on to record more than 40 albums between 1958 and 1974, making her debut with Little Girl Blue. She had a hit single in the United States in 1958 with \"I Loves You, Porgy\".[1] Her musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach,[6] and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice.[7][8]\\nSimone was born on February 21, 1933, in Tryon, North Carolina. The sixth of eight children[9] in a poor family, she began playing piano at the age of three or four; the first song she learned was \"God Be With You, Till We Meet Again\".[10] Demonstrating a talent with the piano, she performed at her local church. Her concert debut, a classical recital, was given when she was 12. Simone later said that during this performance, her parents, who had taken seats in the front row, were forced to move to the back of the hall to make way for white people.[11] She said that she refused to play until her parents were moved back to the front,[12][13] and that the incident contributed to her later involvement in the civil rights movement.[14] Simone\\'s mother, Mary Kate Waymon (née Irvin, November 20, 1901 – April 30, 2001),[15] was a Methodist minister and a housemaid. Her father, Rev. John Devan Waymon (June 24, 1898 – October 23, 1972),[16] was a handyman who at one time owned a dry-cleaning business, but also suffered bouts of ill health. Simone\\'s music teacher helped establish a special fund to pay for her education.[17] Subsequently, a local fund was set up to assist her continued education. With the help of this scholarship money, she was able to attend Allen High School for Girls in Asheville, North Carolina.\\nAfter her graduation, Simone spent the summer of 1950 at the Juilliard School as a student of Carl Friedberg,[18] preparing for an audition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Her application, however, was denied. Only 3 of 72 applicants were accepted that year,[19] but as her family had relocated to Philadelphia in the expectation of her entry to Curtis, the blow to her aspirations was particularly heavy. For the rest of her life, she suspected that her application had been denied because of racial prejudice. Discouraged, she took private piano lessons with Vladimir Sokoloff, a professor at Curtis, but never could re-apply due to the fact that at the time the Curtis institute did not accept students over 21. She took a job as a photographer\\'s assistant, but also found work as an accompanist at Arlene Smith\\'s vocal studio and taught piano from her home in Philadelphia.[18]\\nIn order to fund her private lessons, Simone performed at the Midtown Bar & Grill on Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City, New Jersey, whose owner insisted that she sing as well as play the piano, which increased her income to $90 a week. In 1954, she adopted the stage name \"Nina Simone\". \"Nina\", derived from niña, was a nickname given to her by a boyfriend named Chico,[18] and \"Simone\" was taken from the French actress Simone Signoret, whom she had seen in the 1952 movie Casque d\\'Or.[20] Knowing her mother would not approve of playing \"the Devil\\'s music\", she used her new stage name to remain undetected. Simone\\'s mixture of jazz, blues, and classical music in her performances at the bar earned her a small but loyal fan base.[21]\\nIn 1958, she befriended and married Don Ross, a beatnik who worked as a fairground barker, but quickly regretted their marriage.[22] Playing in small clubs in the same year, she recorded George Gershwin\\'s \"I Loves You, Porgy\" (from Porgy and Bess), which she learned from a Billie Holiday album and performed as a favor to a friend. It became her only Billboard top\\xa020 success in the United States, and her debut album Little Girl Blue followed in February 1959 on Bethlehem Records.[23][24][25]  Because she had sold her rights outright for $3,000, Simone lost more than $1 million in royalties (notably for the 1980s re-release of her version of the jazz standard \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\") and never benefited financially from the album\\'s sales.[26]\\nAfter the success of Little Girl Blue, Simone signed a contract with Colpix Records and recorded a multitude of studio and live albums. Colpix relinquished all creative control to her, including the choice of material that would be recorded, in exchange for her signing the contract with them. After the release of her live album Nina Simone at Town Hall, Simone became a favorite performer in Greenwich Village.[27] By this time, Simone performed pop music only to make money to continue her classical music studies, and was indifferent about having a recording contract. She kept this attitude toward the record industry for most of her career.[28]\\nSimone married a New York police detective, Andrew Stroud, in December 1961. In few years he became her manager and the father of her daughter Lisa, but later he abused Simone psychologically and physically.[3][29][30]\\nIn 1964, Simone changed record distributors from Colpix, an American company, to the Dutch Philips Records, which meant a change in the content of her recordings. She had always included songs in her repertoire that drew on her African-American heritage, such as \"Brown Baby\" by Oscar Brown and \"Zungo\" by Michael Olatunji on her album Nina at the Village Gate in 1962. On her debut album for Philips, Nina Simone in Concert (1964), for the first time she addressed racial inequality in the United States in the song \"Mississippi Goddam\". This was her response to the June 12, 1963, murder of Medgar Evers and the September 15, 1963, bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four young black girls and partly blinded a fifth. She said that the song was \"like throwing ten bullets back at them\", becoming one of many other protest songs written by Simone. The song was released as a single, and it was boycotted in some[vague] southern states.[31][32] Promotional copies were smashed by a Carolina radio station and returned to Philips.[33] She later recalled how \"Mississippi Goddam\" was her \"first civil rights song\" and that the song came to her \"in a rush of fury, hatred and determination\". The song challenged the belief that race relations could change gradually and called for more immediate developments: \"me and my people are just about due\". It was a key moment in her path to Civil Rights activism.[34] \"Old Jim Crow\", on the same album, addressed the Jim Crow laws. After \"Mississippi Goddam\", a civil rights message was the norm in Simone\\'s recordings and became part of her concerts. As her political activism rose, the rate of release of her music slowed.\\nSimone performed and spoke at civil rights meetings, such as at the Selma to Montgomery marches.[35] Like Malcolm X, her neighbor in Mount Vernon, New York, she supported black nationalism and advocated violent revolution rather than Martin Luther King Jr.\\'s non-violent approach.[36] She hoped that African Americans could use armed combat to form a separate state, though she wrote in her autobiography that she and her family regarded all races as equal.\\nIn 1967, Simone moved from Philips to RCA Victor. She sang \"Backlash Blues\" written by her friend, Harlem Renaissance leader Langston Hughes, on her first RCA album, Nina Simone Sings the Blues (1967). On Silk & Soul (1967), she recorded Billy Taylor\\'s \"I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free\" and \"Turning Point\". The album \\'Nuff Said! (1968) contained live recordings from the Westbury Music Fair of April 7, 1968, three days after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. She dedicated the performance to him and sang \"Why? (The King of Love Is Dead)\", a song written by her bass player, Gene Taylor.[37] In 1969, she performed at the Harlem Cultural Festival in Harlem\\'s Mount Morris Park.\\nSimone and Weldon Irvine turned the unfinished play To Be Young, Gifted and Black by Lorraine Hansberry into a civil rights song of the same name. She credited her friend Hansberry with cultivating her social and political consciousness. She performed the song live on the album Black Gold (1970). A studio recording was released as a single, and renditions of the song have been recorded by Aretha Franklin (on her 1972 album Young, Gifted and Black) and Donny Hathaway.[31] When reflecting on this period, she wrote in her autobiography, \"I felt more alive then than I feel now because I was needed, and I could sing something to help my people\".[38]\\nIn an interview for Jet magazine, Simone stated that her controversial song \"Mississippi Goddam\" harmed her career. She claimed that the music industry punished her by boycotting her records.[39] Hurt and disappointed, Simone left the US in September 1970, flying to Barbados and expecting her husband and manager (Andrew Stroud) to communicate with her when she had to perform again. However, Stroud interpreted Simone\\'s sudden disappearance, and the fact that she had left behind her wedding ring, as an indication of her desire for a divorce. As her manager, Stroud was in charge of Simone\\'s income.\\nWhen Simone returned to the United States, she learned that a warrant had been issued for her arrest for unpaid taxes (unpaid as a protest against her country\\'s involvement with the Vietnam War), and returned to Barbados to evade the authorities and prosecution.[40] Simone stayed in Barbados for quite some time, and had a lengthy affair with the Prime Minister, Errol Barrow.[41][42] A close friend, singer Miriam Makeba, then persuaded her to go to Liberia. When Simone relocated, she abandoned her daughter Lisa in Mount Vernon.[43] Lisa eventually reunited with Simone in Liberia, but, according to Lisa, her mother was physically and mentally abusive.[44] The abuse was so unbearable that Lisa became suicidal and she moved back to New York to live with her father Andrew Stroud.[43][44] Simone recorded her last album for RCA, It Is Finished, in 1974, and did not make another record until 1978, when she was persuaded to go into the recording studio by CTI Records owner Creed Taylor. The result was the album Baltimore, which, while not a commercial success, was fairly well received critically and marked a quiet artistic renaissance in Simone\\'s recording output.[45] Her choice of material retained its eclecticism, ranging from spiritual songs to Hall & Oates\\' \"Rich Girl\". Four years later, Simone recorded Fodder on My Wings on a French label, Studio Davout.\\nDuring the 1980s, Simone performed regularly at Ronnie Scott\\'s Jazz Club in London, where she recorded the album Live at Ronnie Scott\\'s in 1984. Although her early on-stage style could be somewhat haughty and aloof, in later years, Simone particularly seemed to enjoy engaging with her audiences sometimes, by recounting humorous anecdotes related to her career and music and by soliciting requests.[citation needed] By this time she stayed everywhere and nowhere. She lived in Liberia, Barbados and Switzerland and eventually ended up in Paris. There she regularly performed in a small jazz club called Aux Trois Mailletz for relatively small financial reward. The performances were sometimes brilliant and at other times Nina Simone gave up after fifteen minutes. Often she was too drunk to sing or play the piano properly. Other times she scolded the audience. The end of Nina Simone seemed in sight.[46] Manager Raymond Gonzalez, guitarist Al Schackman and Gerrit de Bruin, a Dutch friend of hers, decided to intervene.\\nNina Simone moved to Nijmegen in the Netherlands in the spring of 1988. She had just scored a huge European hit with the song My Baby Just Cares for Me. A song that she recorded for the first time in 1958 was used in a commercial for Chanel No. 5 perfume in Europe. This led to a re-release of the recording, which stormed to number 4 on UK\\'s NME singles chart, giving her a brief surge in popularity in the UK and elsewhere.[46]\\nIn 1988 she bought an apartment next to the Belvoir Hotel with view on the Waalbrug and Ooijpolder, with the help of her friend Gerrit de Bruin, who lived with his family a few corners away, and kept an eye on her. The idea was to bring Nina Simone to Nijmegen to relax and get back on track. A daily caretaker, Jackie Hammond from London was hired for her. She was known for her temper and outbursts of aggression. Unfortunately, the tantrums also followed her to Nijmegen. Simone was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by a friend of De Bruin, who prescribed Trilafon for her. Despite the miserable illness, it was generally a happy time for Simone in Nijmegen, where she could lead a fairly anonymous life. Only a few recognized her, but most Nijmegen people did not know who she was. Slowly but surely it went uphill with Nina Simone, and she was even able to make money from the Chanel commercial after a legal battle. In 1991 Nina Simone exchanged Nijmegen for the more lively Amsterdam, where she lived for two years with friends and Hammond too.[47][48]\\nIn 1993, she settled near Aix-en-Provence in southern France (Bouches-du-Rhône).[49] In the same year, her final album, A Single Woman, was released. She variously contended that she married or had a love affair with a Tunisian around this time, but that their relationship ended because, \"His family didn\\'t want him to move to France, and France didn\\'t want him because he\\'s a North African.\"[50] During a 1998 performance in Newark, she announced, \"If you\\'re going to come see me again, you\\'ve got to come to France, because I am not coming back.\"[51] She suffered from breast cancer for several years before she died in her sleep at her home in Carry-le-Rouet (Bouches-du-Rhône), on April 21, 2003. Her funeral service was attended by singers Miriam Makeba and Patti LaBelle, poet Sonia Sanchez, actors Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, and hundreds of others. Simone\\'s ashes were scattered in several African countries. She is survived by her daughter, Lisa Celeste Stroud, an actress and singer, who took the stage name Simone, and who has appeared on Broadway in Aida.[52]\\n\\nSimone\\'s consciousness on the racial and social discourse was prompted by her friendship with black playwright Lorraine Hansberry.[53] The influence of Hansberry planted the seed for the provocative social commentary that became an expectation in Simone\\'s repertoire. One of Nina\\'s more hopeful activism anthems, \"To Be Young, Gifted and Black\", was written with collaborator Weldon Irvine in the years following the playwright\\'s passing, acquiring the title of one of Hansberry\\'s unpublished plays.\\nSimone\\'s social commentary was not limited to the civil rights movement; the song \"Four Women\" exposed the eurocentric appearance standards imposed on black women in America,[54] as it explored the internalized dilemma of beauty that is experienced between four black women with skin tones ranging from light to dark. She explains in her autobiography I Put a Spell on You that the purpose of the song was to inspire black women to define beauty and identity for themselves without the influence of societal impositions.[55]\\nThroughout her career, Simone assembled a collection of songs that would later become standards in her repertoire. Some were songs that she wrote herself, while others were new arrangements of other standards, and others had been written especially for the singer. Her first hit song in America was her rendition of George Gershwin\\'s \"I Loves You, Porgy\" (1958). It peaked at number 18 on the Billboard magazine Hot 100 chart.[56]\\nDuring that same period Simone recorded \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\", which would become her biggest success years later, in 1987, after it was featured in a 1986 Chanel No. 5 perfume commercial.[57] A music video was also created by Aardman Studios.[58] Well-known songs from her Philips albums include \"Don\\'t Let Me Be Misunderstood\" on Broadway-Blues-Ballads (1964); \"I Put a Spell on You\", \"Ne me quitte pas\" (a rendition of a Jacques Brel song), and \"Feeling Good\" on I Put a Spell On You (1965); and \"Lilac Wine\" and \"Wild Is the Wind\" on Wild is the Wind (1966).[59]\\n\"Don\\'t Let Me Be Misunderstood\" and her takes on \"Feeling Good\" and \"Sinnerman\" (Pastel Blues, 1965) have remained popular in cover versions (most notably a version of the former song by The Animals), sample usage, and their use on soundtracks for various movies, television series, and video games. \"Sinnerman\" has been featured in the films The Crimson Pirate (1952), The Thomas Crown Affair (1999), High Crimes (2002), Cellular (2004), Déjà Vu (2006), Miami Vice (2006), Golden Door (2006), Inland Empire (2006), and Harriet (2019), as well as in TV series such as Homicide: Life on the Street (1998, \"Sins of the Father\"), Nash Bridges (2000, \"Jackpot\"), Scrubs (2001, \"My Own Personal Jesus\"), Boomtown (2003, \"The Big Picture\"), Person of Interest (2011, \"Witness\"), Shameless (2011, \"Kidnap and Ransom\"), Love/Hate (2011, \"Episode 1\"), Sherlock (2012, \"The Reichenbach Fall\"), The Blacklist (2013, \"The Freelancer\"), Vinyl (2016, \"The Racket\"), Lucifer (2017, \"Favorite Son\"), and The Umbrella Academy (2019, \"Extra Ordinary\"), and sampled by artists such as Talib Kweli (2003, \"Get By\"), Timbaland (2007, \"Oh Timbaland\"), and Flying Lotus (2012, \"Until the Quiet Comes\"). The song \"Don\\'t Let Me Be Misunderstood\" was sampled by Devo Springsteen on \"Misunderstood\" from Common\\'s 2007 album Finding Forever, and by little-known producers Rodnae and Mousa for the song \"Don\\'t Get It\" on Lil Wayne\\'s 2008 album Tha Carter III. \"See-Line Woman\" was sampled by Kanye West for \"Bad News\" on his album 808s & Heartbreak. The 1965 rendition of \"Strange Fruit\", originally recorded by Billie Holiday, was sampled by Kanye West for \"Blood on the Leaves\" on his album Yeezus.\\nSimone\\'s years at RCA-Victor spawned many singles and album tracks that were popular, particularly in Europe. In 1968, it was \"Ain\\'t Got No, I Got Life\", a medley from the musical Hair from the album \\'Nuff Said! (1968) that became a surprise hit for Simone, reaching number 2 on the UK Singles Chart and introducing her to a younger audience.[60][61] In 2006, it returned to the UK Top 30 in a remixed version by Groovefinder.\\nThe following single, a rendition of the Bee Gees\\' \"To Love Somebody\", also reached the UK Top 10 in 1969. \"The House of the Rising Sun\" was featured on Nina Simone Sings the Blues in 1967, but Simone had recorded the song in 1961 and it was featured on Nina at the Village Gate (1962).[62][63]\\nSimone\\'s bearing and stage presence earned her the title \"the High Priestess of Soul\".[64] She was a pianist, singer and performer, \"separately, and simultaneously.\"[29] As a composer and arranger, Simone moved from gospel to blues, jazz, and folk, and to numbers with European classical styling. Besides using Bach-style counterpoint, she called upon the particular virtuosity of the 19th-century Romantic piano repertoire—Chopin, Liszt, Rachmaninoff, and others. Jazz trumpeter Miles Davis spoke highly of Simone, deeply impressed by her ability to play three-part counterpoint (her two hands on the piano and her voice each providing a separate but complementary melody line).[65] Onstage, she incorporated monologues and dialogues with the audience into the program, and often used silence as a musical element.[66]  Throughout most of her life and recording career she was accompanied by percussionist Leopoldo Fleming and guitarist and musical director Al Schackman.[67] She was known to pay close attention to the design and acoustics of each venue, tailoring her performances to individual venues.[65]\\nSimone was perceived as a sometimes difficult or unpredictable performer, occasionally hectoring the audience if she felt they were disrespectful. Schackman would try to calm Simone during these episodes, performing solo until she calmed offstage and returned to finish the engagement. Her early experiences as a classical pianist had conditioned Simone to expect quiet attentive audiences, and her anger tended to flare up at nightclubs, lounges, or other locations where patrons were less attentive.[65] Schackman described her live appearances as hit or miss, either reaching heights of hypnotic brilliance or on the other hand mechanically playing a few songs and then abruptly ending concerts early.\\nSimone is regarded as one of the most influential recording artists of the 20th century.[68] According to Rickey Vincent, she was a pioneering musician whose career was characterized by \"fits of outrage and improvisational genius\". Pointing to her composition of \"Mississippi Goddam\", Vincent said Simone broke the mold, having the courage as \"an established black musical entertainer to break from the norms of the industry and produce direct social commentary in her music during the early 1960s\".[69]\\nIn naming Simone the 29th-greatest singer of all time, Rolling Stone wrote that \"her honey-coated, slightly adenoidal cry was one of the most affecting voices of the civil rights movement\", while making note of her ability to \"belt barroom blues, croon cabaret and explore jazz — sometimes all on a single record.\"[70] In the opinion of AllMusic\\'s Mark Deming, she was \"one of the most gifted vocalists of her generation, and also one of the most eclectic\".[71] Creed Taylor, who annotated the liner notes for Simone\\'s 1978 Baltimore album, said the singer possessed a \"magnificent intensity\" that \"turns everything—even the most simple, mundane phrase or lyric—into a radiant, poetic message\".[72] Jim Fusilli, music critic for The Wall Street Journal, writes that Simone\\'s music is still relevant today: \"it didn\\'t adhere to ephemeral trends, it isn\\'t a relic of a bygone era; her vocal delivery and technical skills as a pianist still dazzle; and her emotional performances have a visceral impact.\"[73]\\n\"She is loved or feared, adored or disliked\", Maya Angelou wrote in 1970, \"but few who have met her music or glimpsed her soul react with moderation\".[74] Robert Christgau, who disliked Simone, wrote that her \"penchant for the mundane renders her intensity as bogus as her mannered melismas and pronunciation (move over, Inspector Clouseau) and the rote flatting of her vocal improvisations.\"[72] Regarding her piano playing, he dismissed Simone as a \"middlebrow keyboard tickler ... whose histrionic rolls insert unconvincing emotion into a song\".[75] He later attributed his generally negative appraisal to Simone\\'s consistent seriousness of manner, depressive tendencies, and classical background.[76]\\nSimone was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the late 1980s.[77] She was known for her temper and outbursts of aggression.[78] In 1985, Simone fired a gun at a record company executive, whom she accused of stealing royalties. Simone said she \"tried to kill him\" but \"missed\".[79]  In 1995 while living in France, she shot and wounded her neighbor\\'s son with an air gun after the boy\\'s laughter disturbed her concentration and she perceived his response to her complaints as racial insults;[80][81] she was sentenced to eight months in jail, which was suspended pending a psychiatric evaluation and treatment.[65]\\nAccording to a biographer, Simone took medication from the mid-1960s onward, although this was supposedly only known to a small group of intimates.[82] After her death the medication was confirmed as the anti-psychotic Trilafon, which Simone\\'s friends and caretakers sometimes surreptitiously mixed into her food when she refused to follow her treatment plan.[65] This fact was kept out of public view until 2004 when a biography, Break Down and Let It All Out, written by Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan, was published posthumously. Singer-songwriter Janis Ian, a one-time friend of Simone\\'s, related in her own autobiography, Society\\'s Child: My Autobiography, two instances to illustrate Simone\\'s volatility: one incident in which she forced a shoe store cashier at gunpoint to take back a pair of sandals she\\'d already worn; and another in which Simone demanded a royalty payment from Ian herself as an exchange for having recorded one of Ian\\'s songs, and then ripped a pay telephone out of its wall when she was refused.[83]\\nSimone was the recipient of a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 2000 for her interpretation of \"I Loves You, Porgy.\" On Human Kindness Day 1974 in Washington, D.C., more than 10,000 people paid tribute to Simone.[84][85]\\nSimone received two honorary degrees in music and humanities, from Amherst College and Malcolm X College.[86][87] She preferred to be called \"Dr. Nina Simone\" after these honors were bestowed upon her.[88] She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.[89]\\nTwo days before her death, Simone learned she would be awarded an honorary degree by the Curtis Institute of Music, the music school that had refused to admit her as a student at the beginning of her career.[4]\\nSimone has received four career Grammy Award nominations,[90] two during her lifetime and two posthumously. In 1968, she received her first nomination for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for the track \"(You\\'ll) Go to Hell\" from her thirteenth album Silk & Soul (1967). The award went to \"Respect\" by Aretha Franklin.\\nSimone garnered a second nomination in the category in 1971, for her Black Gold album, when she again lost to Franklin for \"Don\\'t Play That Song (You Lied)\". Franklin would again win for her cover of Simone\\'s Young, Gifted and Black two years later in the same category which Simone\\'s Black Gold album was nominated and features Simone\\'s original version of \"Young, Gifted and Black\". In 2016, Simone posthumously received a nomination for Best Music Film for the Netflix documentary What Happened, Miss Simone? and in 2018 she received a nomination for Best Rap Song as a songwriter for Jay Z\\'s \"The Story of O.J.\" from his 4:44 album which contained a sample of \"Four Women\" by Simone.\\nIn 2018, Simone was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame[91] by fellow R&B artist Mary J. Blige.[92]\\nIn 2019, \"Mississippi Goddam\" was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[93]\\nMusicians who have cited Simone as important for their own musical upbringing include Elton John (who named one of his pianos after her), Madonna, Aretha Franklin, Adele, David Bowie, Boy George, Emeli Sandé, Antony and the Johnsons, Dianne Reeves, Sade, Janis Joplin, Nick Cave, Van Morrison, Christina Aguilera, Elkie Brooks, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Kanye West, Lena Horne, Bono, John Legend, Elizabeth Fraser, Cat Stevens, Anna Calvi, Cat Power, Lykke Li, Peter Gabriel, Justin Hayward, Maynard James Keenan, Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Mary J.

In late 2019, American rapper Wale released an album titled Wow... That\\'s Crazy, containing a track called \"Love Me Nina/Semiautomatic\" which contains audio clips from Simone.\\nSimone\\'s music has been featured in soundtracks of various motion pictures and video games, including La Femme Nikita (1990), Point of No Return (1993), Shallow Grave (1994), The Big Lebowski (1998), Any Given Sunday (1999), The Thomas Crown Affair (1999), Disappearing Acts (2000), Six Feet Under (2001), The Dancer Upstairs (2002), Before Sunset (2004), Cellular (2004), Inland Empire (2006), Miami Vice (2006), Sex and the City (2008), The World Unseen (2008), Revolutionary Road (2008), Home (2008), Watchmen (2009), The Saboteur (2009), Repo Men (2010), and Beyond the Lights (2014). Frequently her music is used in remixes, commercials, and TV series including \"Feeling Good\", which featured prominently in the Season Four Promo of Six Feet Under (2004). Simone\\'s \"Take Care of Business\" is the closing theme of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015), Simone\\'s cover of Janis Ian\\'s \"Stars\" is played during the final moments of the season 3 finale of BoJack Horseman (2016), and \"I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free\" and \"Don\\'t Let Me Be Misunderstood\" were included in the film Acrimony (2018).\\nThe documentary Nina Simone: La légende (The Legend) was made in the 1990s by French filmmakers and based on her autobiography I Put a Spell on You. It features live footage from different periods of her career, interviews with family, various interviews with Simone then living in the Netherlands, and while on a trip to her birthplace. A portion of footage from The Legend was taken from an earlier 26-minute biographical documentary by Peter Rodis, released in 1969 and entitled simply Nina. Her filmed 1976 performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival is available on video courtesy of Eagle Rock Entertainment and is screened annually in New York City at an event called \"The Rise and Fall of Nina Simone: Montreux, 1976\" which is curated by Tom Blunt.[99]\\nFootage of Simone singing \"Mississippi Goddam\" for 40,000 marchers at the end of the Selma to Montgomery marches can be seen in the 1970 documentary King: A Filmed Record... Montgomery to Memphis and the 2015 Liz Garbus documentary What Happened, Miss Simone?[3]\\nPlans for a Simone biographical film were released at the end of 2005, to be based on Simone\\'s autobiography I Put a Spell on You (1992) and to focus on her relationship in later life with her assistant, Clifton Henderson, who died in 2006; Simone\\'s daughter, Lisa Simone Kelly, has since refuted the existence of a romantic relationship between Simone and Henderson on account of his homosexuality.[100] Cynthia Mort (screenwriter of Will & Grace and Roseanne), wrote the screenplay and directed the 2016 film Nina, starring Zoe Saldana who has since openly apologized for taking the controversial title role.[101][102][103][104]\\nIn 2015, two documentary features about Simone\\'s life and music were released. The first, directed by Liz Garbus, What Happened, Miss Simone? was produced in cooperation with Simone\\'s estate and her daughter, who also served as the film\\'s executive producer. The film was produced as a counterpoint to the unauthorized Cynthia Mort film (Nina, 2016), and featured previously unreleased archival footage. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2015 and was distributed by Netflix on June 26, 2015.[105]  It was nominated on January 14, 2016, for a 2016 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.[106]\\nThe second documentary in 2015, The Amazing Nina Simone is an independent film written and directed by Jeff L. Lieberman, who initially consulted with Simone\\'s daughter, Lisa before going the independent route and then worked closely with Simone\\'s siblings, predominantly Sam Waymon.[107][108] The film debuted in cinemas in October 2015, and has since played more than 100 theatres in 10 countries.[109]\\nShe is the subject of Nina: A Story About Me and Nina Simone, a one-woman show first performed in 2016 at the Unity Theatre, Liverpool — a \"deeply personal and often searing show inspired by the singer and activist Nina Simone\"[110] — and which in July 2017 ran at the Young Vic, before being scheduled to move to Edinburgh\\'s Traverse Theatre.[111]\\nAs well as her 1992 autobiography I Put a Spell on You (1992), written with Stephen Cleary, Simone has been the subject of several books. They include Nina Simone: Don\\'t Let Me Be Misunderstood (2002) by Richard Williams; Nina Simone: Break Down and Let It All Out (2004) by Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan; Princess Noire (2010) by Nadine Cohodas; Nina Simone (2004) by Kerry Acker; Nina Simone, Black is the Color (2005) by Andrew Stroud; and What Happened, Miss Simone? (2016) by Alan Light.\\nSimone also inspired a book of poetry, me and Nina, by Monica Hand.[112]\\nIn 2002, the city of Nijmegen, Netherlands, named a street after her, as \"Nina Simone Street\": she had lived in Nijmegen between 1988 and 1990. On August 29, 2005, the city of Nijmegen, the De Vereeniging concert hall, and more than 50 artists (among whom were Frank Boeijen, Rood Adeo, and Fay Claassen)[113] honored Simone with the tribute concert Greetings from Nijmegen.\\nSimone was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009.[114]\\nIn 2010, a statue in her honor was erected on Trade Street in her native Tryon, North Carolina.[115]\\nThe promotion from the French Institute of Political Studies of Lille (Sciences Po Lille), due to obtain their master\\'s degree in 2021, named themselves in her honor. The decision was made that this promotion was henceforth to be known as \\'la promotion Nina Simone\\' after a vote in 2017.[116]\\nSimone was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.[117]\\nThe Proms paid a homage to Nina Simone in 2019, an event called Mississippi Goddamn was performed by The Metropole Orkest at Royal Albert Hall led by Jules Buckley. Ledisi, Lisa Fischer and Jazz Trio, LaSharVu provided vocals. [118][119]\\n\\n', 'Fats_Waller': '\\nThomas Wright \"Fats\" Waller (May 21, 1904 – December 15, 1943) was an American jazz pianist, organist, composer, violinist, singer, and comedic entertainer.[1] His innovations in the Harlem stride style laid the groundwork for modern jazz piano. His best-known compositions, \"Ain\\'t Misbehavin\\'\" and \"Honeysuckle Rose\", were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1984 and 1999.[2] Waller copyrighted over 400 songs, many of them co-written with his closest collaborator, Andy Razaf. Razaf described his partner as \"the soul of melody... a man who made the piano sing... both big in body and in mind... known for his generosity... a bubbling bundle of joy\". It is possible financial circumstances caused him to compose many more popular songs and sell them to other performers.[3]\\nWaller started playing the piano at the age of six, and became a professional organist at age 15. By the age of 18, he was a recording artist. Waller\\'s first recordings, \"Muscle Shoals Blues\" and \"Birmingham Blues\", were made in October 1922 for Okeh Records.[4] That year, he also made his first player piano roll, \"Got to Cool My Doggies Now\".[4] Waller\\'s first published composition, \"Squeeze Me\", was published in 1924.[5] He became one of the most popular performers of his era, touring internationally and achieving critical and commercial success in the United States and Europe. He died from pneumonia, aged 39.\\nWaller was the seventh child of 11 (five of whom survived childhood) born to Adeline Locket Waller, a musician, and Reverend Edward Martin Waller, a trucker and pastor in New York City.[5][6] He started playing the piano when he was six and graduated to playing the organ at his father\\'s church four years later. His mother instructed him in his youth, and he attended other music lessons, paying for them by working in a grocery store.[5] Waller attended DeWitt Clinton High School for one semester, but left school at 15 to work as an organist at the Lincoln Theater in Harlem, where he earned $32 a week.[7][8] Within 12 months he had composed his first rag. He was the prize pupil and later the friend and colleague of the stride pianist James P. Johnson.[9] His mother died on November 10, 1920 from a stroke due to diabetes.[10]\\nWaller\\'s first recordings, \"Muscle Shoals Blues\" and \"Birmingham Blues\", were made in October 1922 for Okeh Records.[4] That year, he also made his first player piano roll, \"Got to Cool My Doggies Now\".[4] Waller\\'s first published composition, \"Squeeze Me\", was published in 1924.[5]\\nWaller became one of the most popular performers of his era, finding critical and commercial success in the United States and Europe. He was also a prolific songwriter. Pianist and composer Oscar Levant called Waller \"the black Horowitz\".[11] Working with his long-time songwriting partner, lyricist Andy Razaf, Fats also wrote the music and/or performed in several successful Broadway musicals, including 1928\\'s \"Keep Shufflin\\'\",[12] 1929\\'s \"Hot Chocolates\"[13] and (with lyricist George Marion, Jr.) 1943\\'s \"Early To Bed\".[14]\\nWaller is believed to have composed many novelty tunes in the 1920s and 1930s and sold them for small sums,[3] attributed to another composer and lyricist.[15]\\nStandards attributed to Waller, sometimes controversially, include \"I Can\\'t Give You Anything but Love, Baby\". The song was made famous by Adelaide Hall in the Broadway show Blackbirds of 1928.[16]\\nBiographer Barry Singer conjectured that this song was written by Waller and lyricist Andy Razaf and provided a description of the sale given by Waller to the New York Post in 1929—he sold the song for $500 to a white songwriter for use in a financially successful show (consistent with Jimmy McHugh\\'s contributions to Harry Delmar\\'s Revels, 1927, and then to Blackbirds of 1928).[3] He noted that early handwritten manuscripts in the Dana Library Institute of Jazz Studies of \"Spreadin\\' Rhythm Around\" (Jimmy McHugh 1935) are in Waller\\'s hand.[3][17] Jazz historian Paul S. Machlin commented that the Singer conjecture has \"considerable [historical] justification\".[18] According to a biography by Waller\\'s son Maurice, Waller told his son never to play the song within earshot because he had to sell it when he needed money.[6] Maurice Waller wrote that his father objected to hearing \"On the Sunny Side of the Street\" on the radio.[15]\\nThe anonymous sleeve notes on the 1960 RCA Victor album Handful of Keys state that Waller copyrighted over 400 songs, many of them co-written with his closest collaborator, Andy Razaf. Razaf described his partner as \"the soul of melody...a man who made the piano sing...both big in body and in mind... known for his generosity... a bubbling bundle of joy\". In the same notes are comments by clarinetist Gene Sedric, who recorded with Waller in the 1930s. \"Fats was the most relaxed man I ever saw in a studio, and so he made everybody else relaxed. After a balance had been taken, we\\'d just need one take to make a side, unless it was a kind of difficult number.\"\\nWaller played with Nathaniel Shilkret, Gene Austin, Erskine Tate, Fletcher Henderson, McKinney\\'s Cotton Pickers, and Adelaide Hall.\\nOn one occasion his playing seemed to have put him at risk of injury. Waller was kidnapped in Chicago while leaving a performance in 1926. Four men bundled him into a car and took him to the Hawthorne Inn, owned by Al Capone. Waller was ordered inside the building and found a party taking place. With a gun to his back he was pushed towards a piano and told to play. A terrified Waller realized he was the \"surprise guest\" at Capone\\'s birthday party and was relieved that the kidnappers had no intention of killing him.[19]\\nIn 1926, Waller began his recording association with the Victor Talking Machine Company/RCA Victor, his principal record company for the rest of his life, with the organ solos \"St. Louis Blues\" and his composition \"Lenox Avenue Blues\". Although he recorded with several groups, including Morris\\'s Hot Babes (1927), Fats Waller\\'s Buddies (1929) (one of the earliest multiracial groups to record), and McKinney\\'s Cotton Pickers (1929), his most important contribution to the Harlem stride piano tradition was a series of solo recordings of his compositions: \"Handful of Keys\", \"Smashing Thirds\", \"Numb Fumblin\\'\", and \"Valentine Stomp\" (1929). After sessions with Ted Lewis (1931), Jack Teagarden (1931) and Billy Banks\\' Rhythmakers (1932), he began in May 1934 the voluminous series of recordings with a small band known as Fats Waller and his Rhythm. This six-piece group usually included Herman Autrey (sometimes replaced by Bill Coleman or John \"Bugs\" Hamilton), Gene Sedric or Rudy Powell, and Al Casey.[20]\\nWaller wrote \"Squeeze Me\" (1919), \"Keepin\\' Out of Mischief Now\", \"Ain\\'t Misbehavin\\'\" (1929), \"Blue Turning Grey Over You\", \"I\\'ve Got a Feeling I\\'m Falling\" (1929), \"Honeysuckle Rose\" (1929) and \"Jitterbug Waltz\" (1942). He composed stride piano display pieces such as \"Handful of Keys\", \"Valentine Stomp\" and \"Viper\\'s Drag\".\\nHe enjoyed success touring the United Kingdom and Ireland in the 1930s, appearing on one of the first BBC television broadcasts on September 30, 1938.[21] While in Britain, Waller also recorded a number of songs for EMI on their Compton Theatre organ located in their Abbey Road Studios in St John\\'s Wood. He appeared in several feature films and short subject films, most notably Stormy Weather in 1943, which was released July 21, just months before his death. For the hit Broadway show Hot Chocolates, he and Razaf wrote \"(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue\" (1929), which became a hit for Ethel Waters and Louis Armstrong.\\nWaller performed Bach organ pieces for small groups on occasion. He influenced many pre-bebop jazz pianists; Count Basie and Erroll Garner have both revived his hit songs. In addition to his playing, Waller was known for his many humorous quips during his performances.\\nBetween 1926 and the end of 1927, Waller recorded a series of pipe organ solo records. These represent the first time syncopated jazz compositions were performed on a full-sized church organ. In April 1927, Waller played organ at the Vendome in Chicago for movies alongside Louis Armstrong, where his organ-playing was praised for \"witty cueing\" and \"eccentric stop coupling.\"[22]\\nWaller\\'s Victor recording of \"A Little Bit Independent\", written by Joe Burke and Edgar Leslie, was No. 1 on Your Hit Parade for two weeks in 1935. He also charted with \"Whose Honey Are You?\", \"Lulu\\'s Back in Town\", \"Sweet and Low\", \"Truckin\\'\", \"Rhythm and Romance\", \"Sing an Old Fashioned Song to a Young Sophisticated Lady\", \"West Wind\", \"All My Life\", \"It\\'s a Sin to Tell a Lie\", \"Let\\'s Sing Again\", \"Cross Patch\", \"You\\'re Not the Kind\", \"Bye Bye Baby\", \"You\\'re Laughing at Me\", \"I Love to Whistle\", \"Good for Nothing\", \"Two Sleepy People\", and \"Little Curly Hair in a Highchair\".[23]\\n\\nLater in Waller\\'s career, he had the distinction of becoming the first African-American songwriter to compose a hit Broadway musical that was seen by a mostly white audience. Broadway producer Richard Kollmar\\'s hiring of Waller to create the 1943 musical Early to Bed was recalled in a 2016 essay about Waller by John McWhorter, an American academic and linguist who is Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University.Even as late as 1943, the idea of a black composer writing the score for a standard-issue white show was unheard of. When Broadway performer and producer Richard Kollmar began planning Early to Bed, his original idea was for Waller to perform in it as a comic character, not to write the music. Waller was, after all, as much a comedian as a musician. Comedy rarely dates well, but almost 80 years later, his comments and timing during \"Your Feet\\'s Too Big\" are as funny as anything on Comedy Central, and he nearly walks away with the movie Stormy Weather with just one musical scene and a bit of mugging later on, despite the competition of Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, Lena Horne, and the Nicholas Brothers.\\nKollmar\\'s original choice for composer [of Early to Bed] was Ferde Grofé, best known as the orchestrator of George Gershwin\\'s \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" whose signature compositions were portentous concert suites. But Grofé withdrew, and it is to Kollmar\\'s credit that he realized that he had a top-rate pop-song composer available in Waller. Waller\\'s double duty as composer and performer was short-lived. During a cash crisis and in an advanced state of intoxication, Waller threatened to leave the production unless Kollmar bought the rights to his Early to Bed music for $1,000. (This was typical of Waller, who often sold melodies for quick cash when in his cups. The evidence suggests, for example, that the standards \"I Can\\'t Give You Anything but Love\" and \"On the Sunny Side of the Street\" were Waller tunes.) Waller came to his senses the next day, but Kollmar decided that his drinking habits made him too risky a proposition for eight performances a week. From then on, Waller was the show\\'s composer only, with lyrics by George Marion, whose best-remembered work today is the script for the Astaire-Rogers film The Gay Divorcée.[24]Six months after the premiere of Early to Bed, it was still playing in a Broadway theater; at that point newspapers reported Waller\\'s premature death.\\nWaller married Edith Hatchett in 1920, with whom he had his first son, Thomas Waller Jr. in 1921. In 1923 Hatchett divorced Waller.[25] Waller married Anita Rutherford in 1926.[26] Together, they had a son, Maurice Thomas Waller, born on September 10, 1927.[27] In 1928 Waller and Rutherford had their second son, Ronald Waller.[25]\\nIn 1938, Waller was one of the first African Americans to purchase a home in the Addisleigh Park section of St. Albans, Queens, a New York City community with racially restrictive covenants. After his purchase, and litigation in the New York State courts, many prosperous African Americans followed, including many jazz artists, such as Count Basie, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, and Milt Hinton.[28]\\nWaller contracted pneumonia and died on December 15, 1943, while traveling aboard the famous cross-country Los Angeles - Chicago train the Super Chief near Kansas City, Missouri. His final recording session was with an interracial group in Detroit, Michigan, that included white trumpeter Don Hirleman. Waller was returning to New York City from Los Angeles, after the smash success of Stormy Weather, and after a successful engagement at the Zanzibar Room in Santa Monica, California, during which he had fallen ill.[29]:6 More than 4,200 people were estimated to have attended his funeral at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem,[29]:7 which prompted Adam Clayton Powell Jr., who delivered the eulogy, to say that Fats Waller \"always played to a packed house.\"[30] Afterwards, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered over Harlem from an airplane piloted by an unidentified African American World War I aviator.[31]\\nOne descendant is professional football player Darren Waller, who is Fats\\' great-grandson.[32]\\nA Broadway musical showcasing Waller tunes entitled Ain\\'t Misbehavin\\' was produced in 1978 and featured Nell Carter, Andre de Shields, Armelia McQueen, Ken Page, and Charlaine Woodard. (The show and Nell Carter won Tony Awards.) The show opened at the Longacre Theatre and ran for more than 1600 performances. It was revived on Broadway in 1988 at the Ambassador Theatre with the original Broadway Cast. Performed by five African-American actors, the show included such songs as \"Honeysuckle Rose\", \"This Joint Is Jumpin\\'\", and \"Ain\\'t Misbehavin\\'\".\\nRecordings of Fats Waller were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame which is a special Grammy Award established in 1973 to honour recordings that are at least 25 years old and that have \"qualitative or historical significance\".\\nProbably the most talented pianist to keep the music of \"Fats\" Waller alive in the years after his death was Ralph Sutton, who focused his career on playing stride piano. Sutton was a great admirer of Waller, saying \"I\\'ve never heard a piano man swing any better than Fats – or swing a band better than he could. I never get tired of him. Fats has been with me from the first, and he\\'ll be with me as long as I live.\"[34]\\nActor and band leader Conrad Janis also did a lot to keep the stride piano music of \"Fats\" Waller and James P. Johnson alive. In 1949, as an 18-year-old, Janis put together a band of aging jazz greats, consisting of James P. Johnson (piano), Henry Goodwin (trumpet), Edmond Hall (clarinet), Pops Foster (bass) and Baby Dodds (drums), with Janis on trombone.[35]\\nSource:[41]\\nSource:[41]\\n', 'Duke_Ellington': '\\nEdward Kennedy \"Duke\" Ellington (April 29, 1899 – May 24, 1974) was an American composer, pianist, and leader of a jazz orchestra, which he led from 1923 until his death over a career spanning more than six decades.[1]\\nBorn in Washington, D.C., Ellington was based in New York City from the mid-1920s onward and gained a national profile through his orchestra\\'s appearances at the Cotton Club in Harlem. In the 1930s, his orchestra toured in Europe. Although widely considered a pivotal figure in the history of jazz, Ellington embraced the phrase \"beyond category\" as a liberating principle and referred to his music as part of the more general category of American Music.[2]\\nSome of the jazz musicians who were members of Ellington\\'s orchestra, such as saxophonist Johnny Hodges, are considered among the best players in the idiom. Ellington melded them into the best-known orchestral unit in the history of jazz. Some members stayed with the orchestra for several decades. A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78 rpm recording format, Ellington wrote more than one thousand compositions; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy, and many of his pieces have become standards. He also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, for example Juan Tizol\\'s \"Caravan\", and \"Perdido\", which brought a Spanish tinge to big band jazz. In the early 1940s, Ellington began a nearly thirty-year collaboration with composer-arranger-pianist Billy Strayhorn, whom he called his writing and arranging companion.[3] With Strayhorn, he composed many extended compositions, or suites, as well as additional short pieces. Following an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival in July 1956, Ellington and his orchestra enjoyed a major revival and embarked on world tours. Ellington recorded for most American record companies of his era, performed in and scored several films, and composed a handful of stage musicals.\\nEllington was noted for his inventive use of the orchestra, or big band, and for his eloquence and charisma. His reputation continued to rise after he died, and he was awarded a posthumous Pulitzer Prize Special Award for music in 1999.[4]\\nEllington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy (Kennedy) Ellington in Washington, D.C. Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs, and James preferred operatic arias. They lived with  Daisy\\'s parents at 2129 Ida Place (now Ward Place), NW, in D.C.\\'s West End neighborhood.[5] Duke\\'s father was born in Lincolnton, North Carolina, on April 15, 1879, and moved to D.C. in 1886 with his parents.[6] Daisy Kennedy was born in Washington, D.C., on January 4, 1879, the daughter of two former American slaves.[5][7] James Ellington made blueprints for the United States Navy.\\nWhen Edward Ellington was a child, his family showed racial pride and support in their home, as did many other families. African Americans in D.C. worked to protect their children from the era\\'s Jim Crow laws.[8]\\nAt age seven, Ellington began taking piano lessons from Marietta Clinkscales. Daisy surrounded her son with dignified women to reinforce his manners and teach him elegance. His childhood friends noticed that his casual, offhand manner and dapper dress gave him the bearing of a young nobleman,[9] so they began calling him \"Duke\". Ellington credited his friend Edgar McEntree for the nickname. \"I think he felt that in order for me to be eligible for his constant companionship, I should have a title. So he called me Duke.\"[10]\\nThough Ellington took piano lessons, he was more interested in baseball. \"President Roosevelt (Theodore) would come by on his horse sometimes, and stop and watch us play\", he recalled.[11] Ellington went to Armstrong Technical High School in Washington, D.C. His first job was selling peanuts at Washington Senators baseball games.\\nEllington started sneaking into Frank Holiday\\'s Poolroom at age fourteen. Hearing the music of the poolroom pianists ignited Ellington\\'s love for the instrument, and he began to take his piano studies seriously. Among the many piano players he listened to were Doc Perry, Lester Dishman, Louis Brown, Turner Layton, Gertie Wells, Clarence Bowser, Sticky Mack, Blind Johnny, Cliff Jackson, Claude Hopkins, Phil Wurd, Caroline Thornton, Luckey Roberts, Eubie Blake, Joe Rochester, and Harvey Brooks.[12]\\nIn the summer of 1914, while working as a soda jerk at the Poodle Dog Café, Ellington wrote his first composition, \"Soda Fountain Rag\" (also known as the \"Poodle Dog Rag\"). He created the piece by ear, as he had not yet learned to read and write music. \"I would play the \\'Soda Fountain Rag\\' as a one-step, two-step, waltz, tango, and fox trot\", Ellington recalled. \"Listeners never knew it was the same piece. I was established as having my own repertoire.\"[13] In his autobiography, Music is my Mistress (1973), Ellington wrote that he missed more lessons than he attended, feeling at the time that piano was not his talent.\\nEllington continued listening to, watching, and imitating ragtime pianists, not only in Washington, D.C., but in Philadelphia and Atlantic City, where he vacationed with his mother during the summer.[13]  He would sometimes hear strange music played by those who could not afford much sheet music, so for variations, they played the sheets upside down.[14] Henry Lee Grant, a Dunbar High School music teacher, gave him private lessons in harmony. With the additional guidance of Washington pianist and band leader Oliver \"Doc\" Perry, Ellington learned to read sheet music, project a professional style, and improve his technique. Ellington was also inspired by his first encounters with stride pianists James P. Johnson and Luckey Roberts. Later in New York he took advice from Will Marion Cook, Fats Waller and Sidney Bechet. He started to play gigs in cafés and clubs in and around Washington, D.C. His attachment to music was so strong that in 1916 he turned down an art scholarship to the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Three months before graduating, he dropped out of Armstrong Manual Training School, where he was studying commercial art.[15]\\nWorking as a freelance sign-painter from 1917, Ellington began assembling groups to play for dances. In 1919 he met drummer Sonny Greer from New Jersey, who encouraged Ellington\\'s ambition to become a professional musician. Ellington built his music business through his day job: when a customer asked him to make a sign for a dance or party, he would ask if they had musical entertainment; if not, Ellington would offer to play for the occasion. He also had a messenger job with the U.S. Navy and State departments, where he made a wide range of contacts.\\nEllington moved out of his parents\\' home and bought his own as he became a successful pianist. At first, he played in other ensembles, and in late 1917 formed his first group, \"The Duke\\'s Serenaders\" (\"Colored Syncopators\", his telephone directory advertising proclaimed).[15] He was also the group\\'s booking agent. His first play date was at the True Reformer\\'s Hall, where he took home 75 cents.[16]\\nEllington played throughout the D.C. area and into Virginia for private society balls and embassy parties. The band included childhood friend Otto Hardwick, who began playing the string bass, then moved to C-melody sax and finally settled on alto saxophone; Arthur Whetsol on trumpet; Elmer Snowden on banjo; and Sonny Greer on drums. The band thrived, performing for both African-American and white audiences, a rarity in the segregated society of the day.[17]\\nWhen his drummer Sonny Greer was invited to join the Wilber Sweatman Orchestra in New York City, Ellington left his successful career in D.C. and moved to Harlem, ultimately becoming part of the Harlem Renaissance. New dance crazes such as the Charleston emerged in Harlem, as well as African-American musical theater, including Eubie Blake\\'s Shuffle Along. After the young musicians left the Sweatman Orchestra to strike out on their own, they found an emerging jazz scene that was highly competitive with difficult inroad. They hustled pool by day and played whatever gigs they could find. The young band met stride pianist Willie \"The Lion\" Smith, who introduced them to the scene and gave them some money. They played at rent-house parties for income. After a few months, the young musicians returned to Washington, D.C., feeling discouraged.\\nIn June 1923 they played a gig in Atlantic City, New Jersey and  another at the prestigious Exclusive Club in Harlem. This was followed in September 1923 by a move to the Hollywood Club (at 49th and Broadway) and a four-year engagement, which gave Ellington a solid artistic base. He was known to play the bugle at the end of each performance. The group was initially called Elmer Snowden and his Black Sox Orchestra and had seven members, including trumpeter James \"Bubber\" Miley. They renamed themselves The Washingtonians. Snowden left the group in early 1924 and Ellington took over as bandleader. After a fire, the club was re-opened as the Club Kentucky (often referred to as the Kentucky Club).\\nEllington then made eight records in 1924, receiving composing credit on three including \"Choo Choo\".[18] In 1925, Ellington contributed four songs to Chocolate Kiddies starring Lottie Gee and Adelaide Hall,[19] an all-African-American revue which introduced European audiences to African-American styles and performers. Duke Ellington and his Kentucky Club Orchestra grew to a group of ten players; they developed their own sound by displaying the non-traditional expression of Ellington\\'s arrangements, the street rhythms of Harlem, and the exotic-sounding trombone growls and wah-wahs, high-squealing trumpets, and saxophone blues licks of the band members. For a short time, soprano saxophonist and clarinetist Sidney Bechet played with them, reportedly becoming the dominant personality in the group, with Sonny Greer saying Bechet \"fitted out the band like a glove\". His presence resulted in friction with Miley and trombonist Charlie Irvis whose style\\'s differed from Bechet\\'s New Orleans influenced playing. It was mainly Bechet\\'s unreliability—he was absent for three days in succession—which made his association with Ellington short-lived.[20]\\nIn October 1926, Ellington made an agreement with agent-publisher Irving Mills,[21] giving Mills a 45% interest in Ellington\\'s future.[22] Mills had an eye for new talent and published compositions by Hoagy Carmichael, Dorothy Fields, and Harold Arlen early in their careers. After recording a handful of acoustic titles during 1924–26, Ellington\\'s signing with Mills allowed him to record prolifically, although sometimes he recorded different versions of the same tune. Mills often took a co-composer credit. From the beginning of their relationship, Mills arranged recording sessions on nearly every label including Brunswick, Victor, Columbia, OKeh, Pathê (and its Perfect label), the ARC/Plaza group of labels (Oriole, Domino, Jewel, Banner) and their dime-store labels (Cameo, Lincoln, Romeo), Hit of the Week, and Columbia\\'s cheaper labels (Harmony, Diva, Velvet Tone, Clarion) labels which gave Ellington popular recognition. On OKeh, his records were usually issued as The Harlem Footwarmers, while the Brunswick\\'s were usually issued as The Jungle Band. Whoopee Makers and the Ten Black Berries were other pseudonyms.\\nIn September 1927, King Oliver turned down a regular booking for his group as the house band at Harlem\\'s Cotton Club;[23] the offer passed to Ellington after Jimmy McHugh suggested him and Mills arranged an audition.[24] Ellington had to increase from a six to eleven-piece group to meet the requirements of the Cotton Club\\'s management for the audition,[25] and the engagement finally began on December 4.[26] With a weekly radio broadcast, the Cotton Club\\'s exclusively white and wealthy clientele poured in nightly to see them. At the Cotton Club, Ellington\\'s group performed all the music for the revues, which mixed comedy, dance numbers, vaudeville, burlesque, music, and illicit alcohol. The musical numbers were composed by Jimmy McHugh and the lyrics by Dorothy Fields (later Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler), with some Ellington originals mixed in. (Here he moved in with a dancer, his second wife Mildred Dixon). Weekly radio broadcasts from the club gave Ellington national exposure, while Ellington also recorded Fields-JMcHugh and Fats Waller–Andy Razaf songs.\\nAlthough trumpeter Bubber Miley was a member of the orchestra for only a short period, he had a major influence on Ellington\\'s sound.[27] As an early exponent of growl trumpet, Miley changed the sweet dance band sound of the group to one that was hotter, which contemporaries termed Jungle Style. In October 1927, Ellington and his Orchestra recorded several compositions with Adelaide Hall. One side in particular, \"Creole Love Call\", became a worldwide sensation and gave both Ellington and Hall their first hit record.[28][29] Miley had composed most of \"Creole Love Call\" and \"Black and Tan Fantasy\". An alcoholic, Miley had to leave the band before they gained wider fame. He died in 1932 at the age of 29, but he was an important influence on Cootie Williams, who replaced him.\\nIn 1929, the Cotton Club Orchestra appeared on stage for several months in Florenz Ziegfeld\\'s Show Girl, along with vaudeville stars Jimmy Durante, Eddie Foy, Jr., Ruby Keeler, and with music and lyrics by George Gershwin and Gus Kahn. Will Vodery, Ziegfeld\\'s musical supervisor, recommended Ellington for the show, and, according to John Hasse\\'s Beyond Category: The Life and Genius of Duke Ellington, \"Perhaps during the run of Show Girl, Ellington received what he later termed \\'valuable lessons in orchestration’ from Will Vodery.” In his 1946 biography, Duke Ellington, Barry Ulanov wrote:\\nFrom Vodery, as he (Ellington) says himself, he drew his chromatic convictions, his uses of the tones ordinarily extraneous to the diatonic scale, with the consequent alteration of the harmonic character of his music, its broadening, The deepening of his resources. It has become customary to ascribe the classical influences upon Duke – Delius, Debussy and Ravel – to direct contact with their music. Actually his serious appreciation of those and other modern composers, came after his meeting with Vodery.[30]Ellington\\'s film work began with Black and Tan (1929), a 19-minute all-African-American RKO short[31] in which he played the hero \"Duke\". He also appeared in the Amos \\'n\\' Andy film Check and Double Check, released in 1930. That year, Ellington and his Orchestra connected with a whole different audience in a concert with Maurice Chevalier and they also performed at the Roseland Ballroom, \"America\\'s foremost ballroom\". Australian-born composer Percy Grainger was an early admirer and supporter. He wrote \"The three greatest composers who ever lived are Bach, Delius and Duke Ellington. Unfortunately Bach is dead, Delius is very ill but we are happy to have with us today The Duke\".[32] Ellington\\'s first period at the Cotton Club concluded in 1931.\\nEllington led the orchestra by conducting from the keyboard using piano cues and visual gestures; very rarely did he conduct using a baton. By 1932 his orchestra consisted of six brass instruments, four reeds, and a four-man rhythm section.[33] As the leader, Ellington was not a strict disciplinarian; he maintained control of his orchestra with a combination of charm, humor, flattery and astute psychology. A complex, private person, he revealed his feelings to only his closest intimates and effectively used his public persona to deflect attention away from himself.\\nEllington signed exclusively to Brunswick in 1932 and stayed with them through to late 1936 (albeit with a short-lived 1933–34 switch to Victor when Irving Mills temporarily moved his acts from Brunswick).\\nAs the Depression worsened, the recording industry was in crisis, dropping over 90% of its artists by 1933.[34] Ivie Anderson was hired as the Ellington Orchestra\\'s featured vocalist in 1931. She is the vocalist on \"It Don\\'t Mean a Thing (If It Ain\\'t Got That Swing)\" (1932) among other recordings. Sonny Greer had been providing occasional vocals and continued to do in a cross-talk feature with Anderson. Radio exposure helped maintain Ellington\\'s public profile as his orchestra began to tour. The other 78s of this era include: \"Mood Indigo\" (1930), \"Sophisticated Lady\" (1933), \"Solitude\" (1934), and \"In a Sentimental Mood\" (1935)\\nWhile Ellington\\'s United States audience remained mainly African-American in this period, the orchestra had a significant following overseas. They travelled to England and Scotland in 1933, as well as France (three concerts at the Salle Pleyel in Paris)[35] and the Netherlands before returning to New York.[36][37] On June 12, 1933, the Duke Ellington Orchestra gave its British debut at the London Palladium;[38] Ellington received an ovation when he walked on stage.[39] They were one of 13 acts on the bill and were restricted to eight short numbers; the booking lasted until June 24.[37][40] The British visit saw Ellington win praise from members of the serious music community, including composer Constant Lambert, which gave a boost to Ellington\\'s interest in composing longer works.\\nHis longer pieces had already begun to appear. Ellington had composed and recorded \"Creole Rhapsody\" as early as 1931 (issued as both sides of a 12\" record for Victor and both sides of a 10\" record for Brunswick), and a tribute to his mother, \"Reminiscing in Tempo\", took four 10\" 78rpm record sides to record in 1935 after her death in that year. Symphony in Black (also 1935), a short film, featured his extended piece \\'A Rhapsody of Negro Life\\'. It introduced Billie Holiday, and won an Academy Award as the best musical short subject.[41] Ellington and his Orchestra also appeared in the features Murder at the Vanities and Belle of the Nineties (both 1934).\\nFor agent Mills the attention was a publicity triumph, as Ellington was now internationally known. On the band\\'s tour through the segregated South in 1934, they avoided some of the traveling difficulties of African-Americans by touring in private railcars. These provided easy accommodations, dining, and storage for equipment while avoiding the indignities of segregated facilities.\\nCompetition was intensifying, though, as swing bands like Benny Goodman\\'s began to receive popular attention. Swing dancing became a youth phenomenon, particularly with white college audiences, and danceability drove record sales and bookings. Jukeboxes proliferated nationwide, spreading the gospel of swing. Ellington\\'s band could certainly swing, but their strengths were mood, nuance, and richness of composition, hence his statement \"jazz is music, swing is business\".[42]\\nFrom 1936, Ellington began to make recordings with smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with \"Jeep\\'s Blues\" for Johnny Hodges, \"Yearning for Love\" for Lawrence Brown, \"Trumpet in Spades\" for Rex Stewart, \"Echoes of Harlem\" for Cootie Williams and \"Clarinet Lament\" for Barney Bigard. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club, which had relocated to the mid-town Theater District. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington\\'s finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year.\\nAfter leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the William Morris Agency. Mills though continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels (the small groups had recorded for the latter), collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well known sides continued to be recorded, \"Caravan\" in 1937, and \"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\" the following year.\\nBilly Strayhorn, originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939.[43] Nicknamed \"Swee\\' Pea\" for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly of the man and their collaborative working relationship, \"my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine\".[44] Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington\\'s works, becoming a second Ellington or \"Duke\\'s doppelganger\". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio.[45] The decade ended with a very successful European tour in 1939 just as World War II loomed in Europe.\\nSome of the musicians who joined Ellington at this time created a sensation in their own right. The short-lived Jimmy Blanton transformed the use of double bass in jazz, allowing it to function as a solo/melodic instrument rather than a rhythm instrument alone. Terminal illness forced him to leave by late 1941 after only about two years. Ben Webster, the orchestra\\'s first regular tenor saxophonist, whose main tenure with Ellington spanned 1939 to 1943, started a rivalry with Johnny Hodges as the orchestra\\'s foremost voice in the sax section.\\nTrumpeter Ray Nance joined, replacing Cootie Williams who had defected to Benny Goodman. Additionally, Nance added violin to the instrumental colors Ellington had at his disposal. Recordings exist of Nance\\'s first concert date on November 7, 1940, at Fargo, North Dakota. Privately made by Jack Towers and Dick Burris, these recordings were first legitimately issued in 1978 as Duke Ellington at Fargo, 1940 Live; they are among the earliest of innumerable live performances which survive. Nance was also an occasional vocalist, although Herb Jeffries was the main male vocalist in this era (until 1943) while Al Hibbler (who replaced Jeffries in 1943) continued until 1951. Ivie Anderson left in 1942 for health reasons after 11 years, the longest term of any of Ellington\\'s vocalists.[47]\\nOnce more recording for Victor (from 1940), with the small groups being issued on their Bluebird label, three-minute masterpieces on 78 rpm record sides continued to flow from Ellington, Billy Strayhorn, Ellington\\'s son Mercer Ellington, and members of the orchestra. \"Cotton Tail\", \"Main Stem\", \"Harlem Air Shaft\", \"Jack the Bear\", and dozens of others date from this period. Strayhorn\\'s \"Take the \"A\" Train\", a hit in 1941, became the band\\'s theme, replacing \"East St. Louis Toodle-Oo\". Ellington and his associates wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices who displayed tremendous creativity.[48] Mary Lou Williams, working as a staff arranger, would briefly join Ellington a few years later.\\nEllington\\'s long-term aim, though, was to extend the jazz form from that three-minute limit, of which he was an acknowledged master.[49] While he had composed and recorded some extended pieces before, such works now became a regular feature of Ellington\\'s output. In this, he was helped by Strayhorn, who had enjoyed a more thorough training in the forms associated with classical music than Ellington. The first of these, Black, Brown and Beige (1943), was dedicated to telling the story of African-Americans, and the place of slavery and the church in their history. Black, Brown and Beige debuted at Carnegie Hall on January 23, 1943, beginning an annual series of Ellington concerts at the venue over the next four years. While some jazz musicians had played at Carnegie Hall before, none had performed anything as elaborate as Ellington\\'s work. Unfortunately, starting a regular pattern, Ellington\\'s longer works were generally not well received.\\nA partial exception was Jump for Joy, a full-length musical based on themes of African-American identity, debuted on July 10, 1941, at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles. Hollywood actors John Garfield and Mickey Rooney invested in the production, and Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles offered to direct.[50] At one performance though, Garfield insisted Herb Jeffries, who was light-skinned, should wear make-up. Ellington objected in the interval, and compared Jeffries to Al Jolson. The change was reverted, and the singer later commented that the audience must have thought he was an entirely different character in the second half of the show.[51]\\nAlthough it had sold-out performances, and received positive reviews,[52] it ran for only 122 performances until September 29, 1941, with a brief revival in November of that year. Its subject matter did not make it appealing to Broadway; Ellington had unfulfilled plans to take it there.[53] Despite this disappointment, a Broadway production of Ellington\\'s Beggar\\'s Holiday, his sole book musical, premiered on December 23, 1946,[54] under the direction of Nicholas Ray.\\nThe settlement of the first recording ban of 1942–44, leading to an increase in royalties paid to musicians, had a serious effect on the financial viability of the big bands, including Ellington\\'s Orchestra. His income as a songwriter ultimately subsidized it. Although he always spent lavishly and drew a respectable income from the orchestra\\'s operations, the band\\'s income often just covered expenses.[55]\\nMusicians enlisting in the military and travel restrictions made touring difficult for the big bands and dancing became subject to a new tax, which continued for many years, affecting the choices of club owners. By the time World War II ended, the focus of popular music was shifting towards singing crooners such as Frank Sinatra and Jo Stafford. As the cost of hiring big bands had increased, club owners now found smaller jazz groups more cost-effective. Some of Ellington\\'s new works, such as the wordless vocal feature \"Transblucency\" (1946) with Kay Davis, were not going to have a similar reach as the newly emerging stars. \\nEllington continued on his own course through these tectonic shifts. While Count Basie was forced to disband his whole ensemble and work as an octet for a time, Ellington was able to tour most of Western Europe between April 6 and June 30, 1950, with the orchestra playing 74 dates over 77 days.[56] During the tour, according to Sonny Greer, the newer works were not performed, though Ellington\\'s extended composition, Harlem (1950) was in the process of being completed at this time. Ellington later presented its score to music-loving President Harry Truman. Also during his time in Europe, Ellington would compose the music for a stage production by Orson Welles. Titled Time Runs in Paris[57] and An Evening With Orson Welles in Frankfurt, the variety show also featured a newly discovered Eartha Kitt, who performed Ellington\\'s original song \"Hungry Little Trouble\" as Helen of Troy.[58]\\nIn 1951, Ellington suffered a significant loss of personnel: Sonny Greer, Lawrence Brown and, most importantly, Johnny Hodges left to pursue other ventures, although only Greer was a permanent departee. Drummer Louie Bellson replaced Greer, and his \"Skin Deep\" was a hit for Ellington. Tenor player Paul Gonsalves had joined in December 1950[56] after periods with Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie and stayed for the rest of his life, while Clark Terry joined in November 1951.[59]\\nDuring the early 1950s, Ellington\\'s career was at a low point with his style being generally seen as outmoded, but his reputation did not suffer as badly as some artists. André Previn said in 1952: \"You know, Stan Kenton can stand in front of a thousand fiddles and a thousand brass and make a dramatic gesture and every studio arranger can nod his head and say, Oh, yes, that\\'s done like this. But Duke merely lifts his finger, three horns make a sound, and I don’t know what it is!\"[60] However, by 1955, after three years of recording for Capitol, Ellington lacked a regular recording affiliation.\\nEllington\\'s appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival on July 7, 1956 returned him to wider prominence and introduced him to a new generation of fans. The feature \"Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue\" comprised two tunes that had been in the band\\'s book since 1937 but largely forgotten until Ellington, who had abruptly ended the band\\'s scheduled set because of the late arrival of four key players, called the two tunes as the time was approaching midnight. Announcing that the two pieces would be separated by an interlude played by tenor saxophonist Paul Gonsalves, Ellington proceeded to lead the band through the two pieces, with Gonsalves\\' 27-chorus marathon solo whipping the crowd into a frenzy, leading the Maestro to play way beyond the curfew time despite urgent pleas from festival organizer George Wein to bring the program to an end.\\nThe concert made international headlines, led to one of only five Time magazine cover stories dedicated to a jazz musician,[61] and resulted in an album produced by George Avakian that would become the best-selling LP of Ellington\\'s career.[62] Much of the music on the vinyl LP was, in effect, simulated, with only about 40% actually from the concert itself. According to Avakian, Ellington was dissatisfied with aspects of the performance and felt the musicians had been under rehearsed.[62] The band assembled the next day to re-record several of the numbers with the addition of the faked sound of a crowd, none of which was disclosed to purchasers of the album. Not until 1999 was the concert recording properly released for the first time. The revived attention brought about by the Newport appearance should not have surprised anyone, Johnny Hodges had returned the previous year,[63] and Ellington\\'s collaboration with Strayhorn had been renewed around the same time, under terms more amenable to the younger man.[64]\\nThe original Ellington at Newport album was the first release in a new recording contract with Columbia Records which yielded several years of recording stability, mainly under producer Irving Townsend, who coaxed both commercial and artistic productions from Ellington.[65]\\nIn 1957, CBS (Columbia Records\\' parent corporation) aired a live television production of A Drum Is a Woman, an allegorical suite which received mixed reviews. His hope that television would provide a significant new outlet for his type of jazz was not fulfilled. Tastes and trends had moved on without him. Festival appearances at the new Monterey Jazz Festival and elsewhere provided venues for live exposure, and a European tour in 1958 was well received. Such Sweet Thunder (1957), based on Shakespeare\\'s plays and characters, and The Queen\\'s Suite (1958), dedicated to Britain\\'s Queen Elizabeth II, were products of the renewed impetus which the Newport appearance helped to create, although the latter work was not commercially issued at the time. The late 1950s also saw Ella Fitzgerald record her Duke Ellington Songbook (Verve) with Ellington and his orchestra—a recognition that Ellington\\'s songs had now become part of the cultural canon known as the \\'Great American Songbook\\'.\\nAround this time Ellington and Strayhorn began to work on film soundtrack scoring. The first of these was Anatomy of a Murder (1959),[33] a courtroom drama directed by Otto Preminger and featuring James Stewart, in which Ellington appeared fronting a roadhouse combo. This was followed by Paris Blues (1961), which featured Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier as jazz musicians. In 2009 Detroit Free Press music critic Mark Stryker wrote that Ellington and Strayhorn\\'s work in Anatomy of a Murder, is \"indispensable, [although] . . . too sketchy to rank in the top echelon among Ellington-Strayhorn masterpiece suites like Such Sweet Thunder and The Far East Suite, but its most inspired moments are their equal.\"[66]\\nFilm historians have recognized the soundtrack \"as a landmark – the first significant Hollywood film music by African Americans comprising non-diegetic music, that is, music whose source is not visible or implied by action in the film, like an on-screen band.\" The score avoided the cultural stereotypes which previously characterized jazz scores and rejected a strict adherence to visuals in ways that presaged the New Wave cinema of the \\'60s\".[67] Ellington and Strayhorn, always looking for new musical territory, produced suites for John Steinbeck\\'s novel Sweet Thursday, Tchaikovsky\\'s Nutcracker Suite and Edvard Grieg\\'s Peer Gynt.\\nIn the early 1960s, Ellington embraced recording with artists who had been friendly rivals in the past, or were younger musicians who focused on later styles. The Ellington and Count Basie orchestras recorded together with the album First Time! The Count Meets the Duke (1961). During a period when Ellington was between recording contracts, he made records with Louis Armstrong (Roulette), Coleman Hawkins, John Coltrane (both for Impulse) and participated in a session with Charles Mingus and Max Roach which produced the Money Jungle (United Artists) album. He signed to Frank Sinatra\\'s new Reprise label, but the association with the label was short-lived.\\nMusicians who had previously worked with Ellington returned to the Orchestra as members: Lawrence Brown in 1960 and Cootie Williams in 1962.\\nThe writing and playing of music is a matter of intent.... You can\\'t just throw a paint brush against the wall and call whatever happens art. My music fits the tonal personality of the player. I think too strongly in terms of altering my music to fit the performer to be impressed by accidental music. You can\\'t take doodling seriously.[13]He was now performing all over the world; a significant part of each year was spent on overseas tours. As a consequence, he formed new working relationships with artists from around the world, including the Swedish vocalist Alice Babs, and the South African musicians Dollar Brand and Sathima Bea Benjamin (A Morning in Paris, 1963/1997).\\nEllington wrote an original score for director Michael Langham\\'s production of Shakespeare\\'s Timon of Athens at the Stratford Festival in Ontario, Canada which opened on July 29, 1963. Langham has used it for several subsequent productions, including a much later adaptation by Stanley Silverman which expands the score with some of Ellington\\'s best-known works.\\nEllington was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1965 but no prize was ultimately awarded that year.[68] Then 66 years old, he joked: \"Fate is being kind to me. Fate doesn\\'t want me to be famous too young.\"[69] In 1999 he was posthumously awarded a special Pulitzer Prize \"commemorating the centennial year of his birth, in recognition of his musical genius, which evoked aesthetically the principles of democracy through the medium of jazz and thus made an indelible contribution to art and culture.\"[4][70]\\nIn September 1965, he premiered the first of his Sacred Concerts. He created a jazz Christian liturgy. Although the work received mixed reviews, Ellington was proud of the composition and performed it dozens of times. This concert was followed by two others of the same type in 1968 and 1973, known as the Second and Third Sacred Concerts. These generated controversy in what was already a tumultuous time in the United States. Many saw the Sacred Music suites as an attempt to reinforce commercial support for organized religion, though Ellington simply said it was \"the most important thing I\\'ve done\".[71] The Steinway piano upon which the Sacred Concerts were composed is part of the collection of the Smithsonian\\'s National Museum of American History. Like Haydn and Mozart, Ellington conducted his orchestra from the piano – he always played the keyboard parts when the Sacred Concerts were performed.[72]\\nDuke turned 65 in the spring of 1964 but showed no signs of slowing down as he continued to make vital and innovative recordings, including The Far East Suite (1966), New Orleans Suite (1970), Latin American Suite (1972) and The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse (1971), much of it inspired by his world tours. It was during this time that he recorded his only album with Frank Sinatra, entitled Francis A. & Edward K. (1967).\\nAmong the last shows Ellington and his orchestra performed were one on March 21, 1973 at Purdue University\\'s Hall of Music, two on March 22, 1973 at the Sturges-Young Auditorium in Sturgis, Michigan[73] and the Eastbourne Performance on December 1, 1973, later issued on LP.[74] Ellington performed what is considered his final full concert in a ballroom at Northern Illinois University on March 20, 1974.[75]\\nEllington married his high school sweetheart, Edna Thompson (d. 1967), on July 2, 1918, when he was 19.[76] The next spring, on March 11, 1919, Edna gave birth to their only son, Mercer Kennedy Ellington.[76]\\nEllington was joined in New York City by his wife and son in the late twenties, but the couple soon permanently separated.[77] According to her obituary in Jet magazine, she was \"homesick for Washington\" and returned.[78] In 1929, Ellington became the companion of Mildred Dixon,[79] who traveled with him, managed Tempo Music, inspired songs, such as \"Sophisticated Lady\",[80] at the peak of his career, and raised his son.[81][82][83]\\nIn 1938 he left his family (his son was 19) and moved in with Beatrice \"Evie\" Ellis, a Cotton Club employee.[84] Their relationship, though stormy, continued after Ellington met and formed a relationship with Fernanda de Castro Monte in the early 1960s.[85] Ellington supported both women for the rest of his life.[86]\\nEllington\\'s sister Ruth (1915–2004) later ran Tempo Music, his music publishing company.[83] Ruth\\'s second husband was the bass-baritone McHenry Boatwright, whom she met when he sang at her brother\\'s funeral.[87] As an adult, son Mercer Ellington (d. 1996) played trumpet and piano, led his own band, and worked as his father\\'s business manager.[88]\\nEllington was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha[89] and was a freemason associated with Prince Hall Freemasonry.[90]\\nEllington died on May 24, 1974, of complications from lung cancer and pneumonia,[91] a few weeks after his 75th birthday. At his funeral, attended by over 12,000 people at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Ella Fitzgerald summed up the occasion: \"It\\'s a very sad day. A genius has passed.\"[92]\\nHe was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery, the Bronx, New York City.[93]\\nNumerous memorials have been dedicated to Duke Ellington, in cities from New York and Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles.\\nIn Ellington\\'s birthplace, Washington, D.C., the Duke Ellington School of the Arts educates talented students, who are considering careers in the arts, by providing intensive arts instruction and strong academic programs that prepare students for post-secondary education and professional careers. Originally built in 1935, the Calvert Street Bridge was renamed the Duke Ellington Bridge in 1974. Another school is P.S. 004 Duke Ellington in New York.\\nIn 1989, a bronze plaque was attached to the newly named Duke Ellington Building at 2121 Ward Place, NW.[94] In 2012, the new owner of the building commissioned a mural by Aniekan Udofia that appears above the lettering \"Duke Ellington\". In 2010 the triangular park, across the street from Duke Ellington\\'s birth site, at the intersection of New Hampshire and M Streets, NW was named the Duke Ellington Park.\\nEllington\\'s residence at 2728 Sherman Avenue, NW, during the years 1919–1922,[95] is marked by a bronze plaque.\\nOn February 24, 2009, the United States Mint issued a coin with Duke Ellington on it, making him the first African American to appear by himself on a circulating U.S. coin.[96] Ellington appears on the reverse (tails) side of the District of Columbia quarter.[96] The coin is part of the U.S. Mint\\'s program honoring the District and the U.S. territories[97] and celebrates Ellington\\'s birthplace in the District of Columbia.[96] Ellington is depicted on the quarter seated at a piano, sheet music in hand, along with the inscription \"Justice for All\", which is the District\\'s motto.[97]\\nIn 1986 a United States commemorative stamp was issued featuring Ellington\\'s likeness.[98]\\nEllington lived out his final years in Manhattan, in a townhouse at 333 Riverside Drive near West 106th Street. His sister Ruth, who managed his publishing company, also lived there, and his son Mercer lived next door. After his death, West 106th Street was officially renamed Duke Ellington Boulevard.\\nA large memorial to Ellington, created by sculptor Robert Graham, was dedicated in 1997 in New York\\'s Central Park, near Fifth Avenue and 110th Street, an intersection named Duke Ellington Circle.\\nA statue of Ellington at a piano is featured at the entrance to UCLA\\'s Schoenberg Hall. According to UCLA magazine:\\nWhen UCLA students were entranced by Duke Ellington\\'s provocative tunes at a Culver City club in 1937, they asked the budding musical great to play a free concert in Royce Hall. \\'I\\'ve been waiting for someone to ask us!\\' Ellington exclaimed.\\nOn the day of the concert, Ellington accidentally mixed up the venues and drove to USC instead. He eventually arrived at the UCLA campus and, to apologize for his tardiness, played to the packed crowd for more than four hours. And so, \"Sir Duke\" and his group played the first-ever jazz performance in a concert venue.[99]The Essentially Ellington High School Jazz Band Competition and Festival is a nationally renowned annual competition for prestigious high school bands. Started in 1996 at Jazz at Lincoln Center, the festival is named after Ellington because of the large focus that the festival places on his works.\\nAfter Duke died, his son Mercer took over leadership of the orchestra, continuing until his own death in 1996. Like the Count Basie Orchestra, this \"ghost band\" continued to release albums for many years. Digital Duke, credited to The Duke Ellington Orchestra, won the 1988 Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album. Mercer Ellington had been handling all administrative aspects of his father\\'s business for several decades. Mercer\\'s children continue a connection with their grandfather\\'s work.\\nGunther Schuller wrote in 1989:\\nEllington composed incessantly to the very last days of his life. Music was indeed his mistress; it was his total life and his commitment to it was incomparable and unalterable. In jazz he was a giant among giants. And in twentieth century music, he may yet one day be recognized as one of the half-dozen greatest masters of our time.[100]Martin Williams said: \"Duke Ellington lived long enough to hear himself named among our best composers. And since his death in 1974, it has become not at all uncommon to see him named, along with Charles Ives, as the greatest composer we have produced, regardless of category.\"[101]\\nIn the opinion of Bob Blumenthal of The Boston Globe in 1999: \"[i]n the century since his birth, there has been no greater composer, American or otherwise, than Edward Kennedy Ellington.\"[102]\\nIn 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Duke Ellington on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.[103]\\nHis compositions have been revisited by artists and musicians around the world both as a source of inspiration and a bedrock of their own performing careers.\\nThere are hundreds of albums dedicated to the music of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn by artists famous and obscure. Sophisticated Ladies, an award-winning 1981 musical revue, incorporated many tunes from Ellington\\'s repertoire. A second Broadway musical interpolating Ellington\\'s music, Play On!, debuted in 1997.\\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Duke Ellington among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[105]\\nEllington earned 14 Grammy awards from 1959 to 2000, three of which were posthumous and a total of 24 nominations\\nRecordings of Duke Ellington were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least 25 years old, and that have qualitative or historical significance.\\n', 'Louis_Armstrong': '\\nLouis Daniel Armstrong (August 4, 1901 – July 6, 1971), nicknamed \"Satchmo\", \"Satch\", and \"Pops\",[2] was an American trumpeter and vocalist who was among the most influential figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades and different eras in the history of jazz.[3]\\nArmstrong was born and raised in New Orleans. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance.[4] Around 1922, he followed his mentor, Joe \"King\" Oliver, to Chicago to play in the Creole Jazz Band. In Chicago, he spent time with other popular jazz musicians, reconnecting with his friend Bix Beiderbecke and spending time with Hoagy Carmichael and Lil Hardin. He earned a reputation at \"cutting contests\" and his fame reached band leader Fletcher Henderson.  Henderson persuaded Armstrong to come to New York City, where he became a featured and musically influential band soloist and recording artist.  Hardin became Armstrong\\'s second wife and they returned to Chicago to play together and then he began to form his own \"Hot\" jazz bands.  After years of touring, he settled in Queens, and by the 1950s, he was a national musical icon, assisted in part, by his appearances on radio and in film and television, in addition to his concerts.\\nWith his instantly recognizable rich, gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song. He was also skilled at scat singing. Armstrong is renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice as well as his trumpet playing. By the end of Armstrong\\'s life, his influence had spread to popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first popular African-American entertainers to \"cross over\" to wide popularity with white (and international) audiences. He rarely publicly politicized his race, to the dismay of fellow African Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation in the Little Rock crisis. He was able to access the upper echelons of American society at a time when this was difficult for black men.\\nArmstrong appeared in films such as High Society (1956) alongside Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, and Frank Sinatra, and Hello, Dolly! (1969) starring Barbra Streisand. He received many accolades including three Grammy Award nominations and a win for his vocal performance of Hello, Dolly! in 1964.[5] In 2017, he was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame.\\nArmstrong was born in New Orleans on August 4, 1901.[6][7][8][a] His parents were Mary Albert and William Armstrong. Mary Albert was from Boutte, Louisiana, and gave birth at home when she was about sixteen. William Armstrong abandoned the family shortly after.[11] About two years later, he had a daughter, Beatrice \"Mama Lucy\" Armstrong, who was raised by Albert.[12]\\nLouis Armstrong was raised by his grandmother until the age of five when he was returned to his mother.[11] He spent his youth in poverty in a rough neighborhood known as The Battlefield.[13] At six he attended the Fisk School for Boys,[14] a school that accepted black children in the racially segregated system of New Orleans. He did odd jobs for the Karnoffskys, a family of Lithuanian Jews. He briefly studied shipping management at the local community college, but was forced to quit after being unable to afford the fees.[15] While selling coal in Storyville, he heard spasm bands, groups that played music out of household objects. He heard the early sounds of jazz from bands that played in brothels and dance halls such as Pete Lala\\'s, where King Oliver performed.[16]\\nThe Karnoffskys[17] took him in and treated him like family. Knowing he lived without a father, they fed and nurtured him.[18][19] In his memoir Louis Armstrong + the Jewish Family in New Orleans, La., the Year of 1907, he described his discovery that this family was also subject to discrimination by \"other white folks\" who felt that they were better than Jews: \"I was only seven years old but I could easily see the ungodly treatment that the white folks were handing the poor Jewish family whom I worked for.\"[20] He wore a Star of David pendant for the rest of his life and wrote about what he learned from them: \"how to live—real life and determination.\"[18] His first musical performance may have been at the side of the Karnoffskys\\' junk wagon. To distinguish them from other hawkers, he tried playing a tin horn to attract customers. Morris Karnoffsky gave Armstrong an advance toward the purchase of a cornet from a pawn shop.[21]\\nWhen Armstrong was eleven, he dropped out of school.[14] His mother moved into a one-room house on Perdido Street with him, Lucy, and her common-law husband, Tom Lee, next door to her brother Ike and his two sons.[22] Armstrong joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money. He also got into trouble. Cornetist Bunk Johnson said he taught the eleven-year-old to play by ear at Dago Tony\\'s honky tonk.[23] (In his later years Armstrong credited King Oliver.) He said about his youth, \"Every time I close my eyes blowing that trumpet of mine—I look right in the heart of good old New Orleans ... It has given me something to live for.\"[24]\\nBorrowing his stepfather\\'s gun without permission, he fired a blank into the air and was arrested on December 31, 1912. He spent the night at New Orleans Juvenile Court, then was sentenced the next day to detention at the Colored Waif\\'s Home.[25] Life at the home was spartan. Mattresses were absent; meals were often little more than bread and molasses. Captain Joseph Jones ran the home like a military camp and used corporal punishment.[26]\\nArmstrong developed his cornet skills by playing in the band. Peter Davis, who frequently appeared at the home at the request of Captain Jones,[27] became Armstrong\\'s first teacher and chose him as bandleader. With this band, the thirteen-year-old Armstrong attracted the attention of Kid Ory.[28]\\nOn June 14, 1914, Armstrong was released into the custody of his father and his new stepmother, Gertrude. He lived in this household with two stepbrothers for several months. After Gertrude gave birth to a daughter, Armstrong\\'s father never welcomed him, so he returned to his mother, Mary Albert. In her small home, he had to share a bed with his mother and sister.[29] His mother still lived in The Battlefield, leaving him open to old temptations, but he sought work as a musician. He found a job at a dance hall owned by Henry Ponce, who had connections to organized crime. He met the six-foot tall drummer Black Benny, who became his guide and bodyguard.[30] Around the age of fifteen, he pimped for a prostitute named Nootsy, but that relationship failed after she stabbed Armstrong in the shoulder and his mother choked her nearly to death.[31]\\nArmstrong played in brass bands and riverboats in New Orleans, first on an excursion boat in September 1918. He traveled with the band of Fate Marable, which toured on the steamboat Sidney with the Streckfus Steamers line up and down the Mississippi River.[32] Marable was proud of his musical knowledge, and he insisted that Armstrong and other musicians in his band learn sight reading. Armstrong described his time with Marable as \"going to the University\", since it gave him a wider experience working with written arrangements. He did return to New Orleans periodically.[33] In 1919, Oliver decided to go north and resigned his position in Kid Ory\\'s band; Armstrong replaced him. He also became second trumpet for the Tuxedo Brass Band.[34]\\nThroughout his riverboat experience, Armstrong\\'s musicianship began to mature and expand. At twenty, he could read music. He became one of the first jazz musicians to be featured on extended trumpet solos, injecting his own personality and style. He started singing in his performances.[35] In 1922, he moved to Chicago at the invitation of King Oliver. With Oliver\\'s Creole Jazz Band, he could make enough money to quit his day jobs. Although race relations were poor, Chicago was booming. The city had jobs for blacks making good wages at factories with some left over for entertainment.[36]:86\\nOliver\\'s band was among the most influential jazz bands in Chicago in the early 1920s. Armstrong lived luxuriously in his own apartment with his first private bath. Excited as he was to be in Chicago, he began his career-long pastime of writing letters to friends in New Orleans. Armstrong could blow two hundred high Cs in a row. As his reputation grew, he was challenged to cutting contests by other musicians.[37]\\nHis first studio recordings were with Oliver for Gennett Records on April 5–6, 1923. They endured several hours on the train to remote Richmond, Indiana, and the band was paid little. The quality of the performances was affected by lack of rehearsal, crude recording equipment, bad acoustics, and a cramped studio. In addition, Richmond was associated with the Ku Klux Klan.[38]\\nLil Hardin Armstrong urged him to seek more prominent billing and develop his style apart from the influence of Oliver. She encouraged him to play classical music in church concerts to broaden his skills. She prodded him into wearing more stylish attire to offset his girth. Her influence eventually undermined Armstrong\\'s relationship with his mentor, especially concerning his salary and additional money that Oliver held back from Armstrong and other band members.[39] Armstrong\\'s mother, May Ann Albert, came to visit him in Chicago during the summer of 1923 after being told that Armstrong was \"out of work, out of money, hungry, and sick\"; Hardin located and decorated an apartment for her to live in while she stayed.[40]\\nArmstrong and Oliver parted amicably in 1924. Shortly afterward, Armstrong received an invitation to go to New York City to play with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, the top African-American band of the time. He switched to the trumpet to blend in better with the other musicians in his section. His influence on Henderson\\'s tenor sax soloist, Coleman Hawkins, can be judged by listening to the records made by the band during this period.[41]\\nArmstrong adapted to the tightly controlled style of Henderson, playing trumpet and experimenting with the trombone. The other members were affected by Armstrong\\'s emotional style. His act included singing and telling tales of New Orleans characters, especially preachers.[42] The Henderson Orchestra played in prominent venues for patrons only, including the Roseland Ballroom, with arrangements by Don Redman. Duke Ellington\\'s orchestra went to Roseland to catch Armstrong\\'s performances.\\nDuring this time, Armstrong recorded with Clarence Williams (a friend from New Orleans), the Williams Blue Five, Sidney Bechet, and blues singers  Alberta Hunter, Ma Rainey, and Bessie Smith.[43][44]\\nIn 1925, Armstrong returned to Chicago largely at the insistence of Lil, who wanted to expand his career and his income. In publicity, much to his chagrin, she billed him as \"the World\\'s Greatest Trumpet Player\". For a time he was a member of the Lil Hardin Armstrong Band and working for his wife.[45] He formed Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five and recorded the hits \"Potato Head Blues\" and \"Muggles\". The word \"muggles\" was a slang term for marijuana, something he used often during his life.[36]\\nThe Hot Five included Kid Ory (trombone), Johnny Dodds (clarinet), Johnny St. Cyr (banjo), Lil Armstrong on piano, and usually no drummer. Over a twelve-month period starting in November 1925, this quintet produced twenty-four records.[46] Armstrong\\'s band leading style was easygoing, as St. Cyr noted, \"One felt so relaxed working with him, and he was very broad-minded ... always did his best to feature each individual.\"[47] Among the most notable of the Hot Five and Seven records were \"Cornet Chop Suey\", \"Struttin\\' With Some Barbecue\", \"Hotter Than that\" and \"Potato Head Blues,\" all featuring highly creative solos by Armstrong. According to Thomas Brothers, recordings, such as \"Struttin\\' with Some Barbeque,\" were so superb, \"planned with density and variety, bluesyness, and showiness,\" that they were probably showcased at the Sunset Café.[48] His recordings soon after with pianist Earl \"Fatha\" Hines (most famously their 1928 \"Weather Bird\" duet) and Armstrong\\'s trumpet introduction to and solo in \"West End Blues\" remain some of the most famous and influential improvisations in jazz history. Armstrong was now free to develop his personal style as he wished, which included a heavy dose of effervescent jive, such as \"Whip That Thing, Miss Lil\" and \"Mr. Johnny Dodds, Aw, Do That Clarinet, Boy!\"[49]\\nArmstrong also played with Erskine Tate\\'s Little Symphony, which played mostly at the Vendome Theatre. They furnished music for silent movies and live shows, including jazz versions of classical music, such as \"Madame Butterfly\", which gave Armstrong experience with longer forms of music and with hosting before a large audience. He began to scat sing (improvise vocal jazz using nonsensical words) and was among the first to record it, on the Hot Five recording \"Heebie Jeebies\" in 1926. The recording was so popular that the group became the most famous jazz band in the United States, even though they had not performed live to any great extent. Young musicians across the country, black or white, were turned on by Armstrong\\'s new type of jazz.[50]\\nAfter separating from Lil, Armstrong started to play at the Sunset Café for Al Capone\\'s associate Joe Glaser in the Carroll Dickerson Orchestra, with Earl Hines on piano, which was renamed Louis Armstrong and his Stompers,[51] though Hines was the music director and Glaser managed the orchestra. Hines and Armstrong became fast friends and successful collaborators. It was at the Sunset Café that Armstrong accompanied singer Adelaide Hall. It was during Hall\\'s tenure at the venue that she experimented, developed and expanded her use and art of scat singing with Armstrong\\'s guidance and encouragement.[52]\\nIn the first half of 1927, Armstrong assembled his Hot Seven group, which added drummer Al \"Baby\" Dodds and tuba player, Pete Briggs, while preserving most of his original Hot Five lineup. John Thomas replaced Kid Ory on trombone. Later that year he organized a series of new Hot Five sessions which resulted in nine more records. In the last half of 1928, he started recording with a new group: Zutty Singleton (drums), Earl Hines (piano), Jimmy Strong (clarinet), Fred Robinson (trombone), and Mancy Carr (banjo).[53]\\nArmstrong returned to New York in 1929, where he played in the pit orchestra for the musical Hot Chocolates, an all-black revue written by Andy Razaf and pianist Fats Waller. He also made a cameo appearance as a vocalist, regularly stealing the show with his rendition of \"Ain\\'t Misbehavin\\'\". His version of the song became his biggest selling record to date.[54]\\nArmstrong started to work at Connie\\'s Inn in Harlem, chief rival to the Cotton Club, a venue for elaborately staged floor shows,[55] and a front for gangster Dutch Schultz. Armstrong also had considerable success with vocal recordings, including versions of famous songs composed by his old friend Hoagy Carmichael. His 1930s recordings took full advantage of the new RCA ribbon microphone, introduced in 1931, which imparted a characteristic warmth to vocals and immediately became an intrinsic part of the \\'crooning\\' sound of artists like Bing Crosby. Armstrong\\'s famous interpretation of Carmichael\\'s \"Stardust\" became one of the most successful versions of this song ever recorded, showcasing Armstrong\\'s unique vocal sound and style and his innovative approach to singing songs that had already become standards.\\nArmstrong\\'s radical re-working of Sidney Arodin and Carmichael\\'s \"Lazy River\" (recorded in 1931) encapsulated many features of his groundbreaking approach to melody and phrasing. The song begins with a brief trumpet solo, then the main melody is introduced by sobbing horns, memorably punctuated by Armstrong\\'s growling interjections at the end of each bar: \"Yeah! ...\"Uh-huh\"...\"Sure\"...\"Way down, way down.\" In the first verse, he ignores the notated melody entirely and sings as if playing a trumpet solo, pitching most of the first line on a single note and using strongly syncopated phrasing. In the second stanza he breaks into an almost fully improvised melody, which then evolves into a classic passage of Armstrong \"scat singing\".\\nAs with his trumpet playing, Armstrong\\'s vocal innovations served as a foundation stone for the art of jazz vocal interpretation. The uniquely gravelly coloration of his voice became a musical archetype that was much imitated and endlessly impersonated. His scat singing style was enriched by his matchless experience as a trumpet soloist. His resonant, velvety lower-register tone and bubbling cadences on sides such as \"Lazy River\" exerted a huge influence on younger white singers such as Bing Crosby.\\nThe Great Depression of the early 1930s was especially hard on the jazz scene. The Cotton Club closed in 1936 after a long downward spiral, and many musicians stopped playing altogether as club dates evaporated. Bix Beiderbecke died and Fletcher Henderson\\'s band broke up. King Oliver made a few records but otherwise struggled. Sidney Bechet became a tailor, later moving to Paris and Kid Ory returned to New Orleans and raised chickens.[56]\\nArmstrong moved to Los Angeles in 1930 to seek new opportunities. He played at the New Cotton Club in Los Angeles with Lionel Hampton on drums. The band drew the Hollywood crowd, which could still afford a lavish night life, while radio broadcasts from the club connected with younger audiences at home. Bing Crosby and many other celebrities were regulars at the club. In 1931, Armstrong appeared in his first movie, Ex-Flame and was also convicted of marijuana possession but received a suspended sentence.[57] He returned to Chicago in late 1931 and played in bands more in the Guy Lombardo vein and he recorded more standards. When the mob insisted that he get out of town,[58] Armstrong visited New Orleans, had a hero\\'s welcome, and saw old friends. He sponsored a local baseball team known as Armstrong\\'s Secret Nine and had a cigar named after him.[59] But soon he was on the road again. After a tour across the country shadowed by the mob, he fled to Europe.\\nAfter returning to the United States, he undertook several exhausting tours. His agent Johnny Collins\\'s erratic behavior and his own spending ways left Armstrong short of cash. Breach of contract violations plagued him. He hired Joe Glaser as his new manager, a tough mob-connected wheeler-dealer, who began to straighten out his legal mess, his mob troubles, and his debts. Armstrong also began to experience problems with his fingers and lips, which were aggravated by his unorthodox playing style. As a result, he branched out, developing his vocal style and making his first theatrical appearances. He appeared in movies again, including Crosby\\'s 1936 hit Pennies from Heaven. In 1937, Armstrong substituted for Rudy Vallee on the CBS radio network and became the first African American to host a sponsored, national broadcast.[60]\\nDuring the 1920s, Louis Armstrong brought a huge impact during the Harlem Renaissance within the Jazz world. The music he created was an incredible part of his life during the Harlem Renaissance.[61] His impact touched many, including a well-known man during that time named Langston Hughes. Hughes admired Armstrong and acknowledged him as one of the most recognized musicians during the era.[62] Within Hughes\\' writings, he created many books which held the central idea of jazz and recognition to Armstrong as one of the most important persons to be part of the newfound love of their culture.[63] The sound of jazz, along with many other musicians such as Armstrong, helped shape Hughes as a writer. Just as the musicians, Hughes wrote his words with jazz.[64]\\nArmstrong changed jazz during the Harlem Renaissance. Being known as \"The World\\'s Greatest Trumpet Player\" during this time,[65] Armstrong continued his legacy and continued a focus on his own vocal career. The popularity he gained brought together many black and white audiences to watch him perform.[66]\\nAfter spending many years on the road, Armstrong settled permanently in Queens, New York in 1943 in contentment with his fourth wife, Lucille. Although subject to the vicissitudes of Tin Pan Alley and the gangster-ridden music business, as well as anti-black prejudice, he continued to develop his playing. He recorded Hoagy Carmichael\\'s \"Rockin\\' Chair\" for Okeh Records.\\nDuring the next 30 years, Armstrong played more than 300 performances a year. Bookings for big bands tapered off during the 1940s due to changes in public tastes: ballrooms closed, and there was competition from television and from other types of music becoming more popular than big band music. It became impossible under such circumstances to finance a 16-piece touring band.\\nDuring the 1940s, a widespread revival of interest in the traditional jazz of the 1920s made it possible for Armstrong to consider a return to the small-group musical style of his youth. Armstrong was featured as a guest artist with Lionel Hampton\\'s band at the famed second Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on October 12, 1946.[67]  Following a highly successful small-group jazz concert at New York Town Hall on May 17, 1947, featuring Armstrong with trombonist/singer Jack Teagarden, Armstrong\\'s manager, Joe Glaser dissolved the Armstrong big band on August 13, 1947, and established a six-piece traditional jazz group featuring Armstrong with (initially) Teagarden, Earl Hines and other top swing and Dixieland musicians, most of whom were previously leaders of big bands. The new group was announced at the opening of Billy Berg\\'s Supper Club.\\nThis group was called Louis Armstrong and His All Stars and included at various times Earl \"Fatha\" Hines, Barney Bigard, Edmond Hall, Jack Teagarden, Trummy Young, Arvell Shaw, Billy Kyle, Marty Napoleon, Big Sid \"Buddy\" Catlett, Cozy Cole, Tyree Glenn, Barrett Deems, Mort Herbert, Joe Darensbourg, Eddie Shu, Joe Muranyi and  percussionist Danny Barcelona. During this period, Armstrong made many recordings and appeared in over thirty films. He was the first jazz musician to appear on the cover of Time magazine, on February 21, 1949.  Louis Armstrong and his All Stars were featured at the ninth Cavalcade of Jazz concert also at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. held on June 7, 1953 along with Shorty Rogers, Roy Brown, Don Tosti and His Mexican Jazzmen, Earl Bostic, and Nat \"King\" Cole.[68]\\nBy the 1950s, Armstrong was a widely beloved American icon and cultural ambassador who commanded an international fanbase. However, a growing generation gap became apparent between him and the young jazz musicians who emerged in the postwar era such as Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Sonny Rollins. The postwar generation regarded their music as abstract art and considered Armstrong\\'s vaudevillian style, half-musician and half-stage entertainer, outmoded and Uncle Tomism, \"... he seemed a link to minstrelsy that we were ashamed of.\"[69] He called bebop \"Chinese music\".[70] While touring Australia in 1954, he was asked if he could play bebop. \"Bebop?\" he husked. \"I just play music. Guys who invent terms like that are walking the streets with their instruments under their arms.\"[71]\\nOn February 28, 1948, Suzy Delair sang the French song C\\'est si bon at the Hotel Negresco during the first Nice Jazz Festival. Louis Armstrong was present and loved the song. On June 26, 1950, he recorded the American version of the song (English lyrics by Jerry Seelen) in New York City with Sy Oliver and his Orchestra. When it was released, the disc was a worldwide success and the song was then performed by the greatest international singers.\\nIn the 1960s, he toured Ghana and Nigeria.[72][73]\\nAfter finishing his contract with Decca Records, he became a freelance artist and recorded for other labels.[74][75] He continued an intense international touring schedule, but in 1959 he suffered a heart attack in Italy and had to rest.[76]\\nIn 1964, after over two years without setting foot in a studio, he recorded his biggest-selling record, \"Hello, Dolly!\", a song by Jerry Herman, originally sung by Carol Channing. Armstrong\\'s version remained on the Hot 100 for 22 weeks, longer than any other record produced that year, and went to No.\\xa01 making him, at 62 years, 9 months and 5 days, the oldest person ever to accomplish that feat. In the process, he dislodged the Beatles from the No.\\xa01 position they had occupied for 14 consecutive weeks with three different songs.[77]\\nArmstrong kept touring well into his 60s, even visiting part of the communist bloc in 1965. He also toured Africa, Europe, and Asia under the sponsorship of the US State Department with great success, earning the nickname \"Ambassador Satch\" and inspiring Dave Brubeck to compose his jazz musical The Real Ambassadors. By 1968, he was approaching 70 and his health began to give out. He suffered heart and kidney ailments that forced him to stop touring. He did not perform publicly at all in 1969 and spent most of the year recuperating at home. Meanwhile, his longtime manager Joe Glaser died. By the summer of 1970, his doctors pronounced him fit enough to resume live performances. He embarked on another world tour, but a heart attack forced him to take a break for two months.[79]\\nArmstrong made his last recorded trumpet performances on his 1968 album Disney Songs the Satchmo Way.[80]\\nThe Louis Armstrong House Museum website states:\\nJudging from home recorded tapes now in our Museum Collections, Louis pronounced his own name as \"Lewis\". On his 1964 record \"Hello, Dolly\", he sings, \"This is Lewis, Dolly\" but in 1933 he made a record called \"Laughin\\' Louie\". Many broadcast announcers, fans, and acquaintances called him \"Louie\" and in a videotaped interview from 1983 Lucille Armstrong calls her late husband \"Louie\" as well. Musicians and close friends usually called him \"Pops\".[81]In a memoir written for Robert Goffin between 1943 and 1944, Armstrong states, \"All white folks call me Louie,\" perhaps suggesting that he himself did not or, on the other hand, that no whites addressed him by one of his nicknames such as Pops.[82] That said, Armstrong was registered as \"Lewie\" for the 1920 U.S. Census. On various live records he\\'s called \"Louie\" on stage, such as on the 1952 \"Can Anyone Explain?\" from the live album In Scandinavia vol.1. The same applies to his 1952 studio recording of the song \"Chloe\", where the choir in the background sings \"Louie ... Louie\", with Armstrong responding \"What was that? Somebody called my name?\" \"Lewie\" is the French pronunciation of \"Louis\" and is commonly used in Louisiana.\\nArmstrong was performing at the Brick House in Gretna, Louisiana, when he met Daisy Parker, a local prostitute. He started the affair as a client. He returned to Gretna on several occasions to visit her. He found the courage to look for her home to see her away from work. It was on this occasion that he found out that she had a common-law husband. Not long after this fiasco, Parker traveled to Armstrong\\'s home on Perdido Street.[83] They checked into Kid Green\\'s hotel that evening. On the next day, March 19, 1919, Armstrong and Parker married at City Hall.[83][84] They adopted a three-year-old boy, Clarence, whose mother, Armstrong\\'s cousin Flora, had died soon after giving birth. Clarence Armstrong was mentally disabled as the result of a head injury at an early age, and Armstrong spent the rest of his life taking care of him.[85] His marriage to Parker ended when they separated in 1923.\\nOn February 4, 1924, he married Lil Hardin Armstrong, King Oliver\\'s pianist. She had divorced her first husband a few years earlier. His second wife helped him develop his career, but they separated in 1931 and divorced in 1938. Armstrong then married Alpha Smith.[86] His relationship with Alpha, however, began while he was playing at the Vendome during the 1920s and continued long after.[87] His marriage to his third wife lasted four years, and they divorced in 1942. Louis then married Lucille Wilson, a singer at the Cotton Club in New York, in October 1942; they remained married until his death in 1971.[88]\\nArmstrong\\'s marriages never produced any offspring.[89] However, in December 2012, 57-year-old Sharon Preston-Folta claimed to be his daughter from a 1950s affair between Armstrong and Lucille \"Sweets\" Preston, a dancer at the Cotton Club.[90] In a 1955 letter to his manager, Joe Glaser, Armstrong affirmed his belief that Preston\\'s newborn baby was his daughter, and ordered Glaser to pay a monthly allowance of $400 (US$4,772 in 2019 dollars[91]) to mother and child.[92]\\nArmstrong was noted for his colorful and charismatic personality. His autobiography vexed some biographers and historians, as he had a habit of telling tales, particularly of his early childhood when he was less scrutinized, and his embellishments of his history often lack consistency.[93]\\nIn addition to being an entertainer, Armstrong was a leading personality of the day.  He was beloved by an American public that gave even the greatest African American performers little access beyond their public celebrity, and he was able to live a private life of access and privilege afforded to few other African Americans during that era.[93]\\nHe generally remained politically neutral, which at times alienated him from members of the black community who looked to him to use his prominence with white America to become more of an outspoken figure during the civil rights movement. However, he did criticize President Eisenhower for not acting forcefully enough on civil rights.[93]\\nThe trumpet is a notoriously hard instrument on the lips, and Armstrong suffered from lip damage over much of his life due to his aggressive style of playing and preference for narrow mouthpieces that would stay in place easier, but which tended to dig into the soft flesh of his inner lip. During his 1930s European tour, he suffered an ulceration so severe that he had to stop playing entirely for a year. Eventually he took to using salves and creams on his lips and also cutting off scar tissue with a razor blade. By the 1950s, he was an official spokesman for Ansatz-Creme Lip Salve.[94]\\nDuring a backstage meeting with trombonist Marshall Brown in 1959, Armstrong received the suggestion that he should go to a doctor and receive proper treatment for his lips instead of relying on home remedies, but he did not get around to doing it until the final years of his life, by which point his health was failing and doctors considered surgery too risky.[95]\\nThe nicknames \"Satchmo\" and \"Satch\" are short for \"Satchelmouth\". The nickname has many possible origins.[93] The most common tale that biographers tell is the story of Armstrong as a young boy in New Orleans dancing for pennies. He scooped the coins off the street and stuck them into his mouth to prevent bigger children from stealing them. Someone dubbed him \"satchel mouth\" for his mouth acting as a satchel. Another tale is that because of his large mouth, he was nicknamed \"satchel mouth\" which was shortened to \"Satchmo\".[93]\\nEarly on he was also known as \"Dipper\", short for \"Dippermouth\", a reference to the piece Dippermouth Blues.[96] and something of a riff on his unusual embouchure.\\nThe nickname \"Pops\" came from Armstrong\\'s own tendency to forget people\\'s names and simply call them \"Pops\" instead. The nickname was turned on Armstrong himself. It was used as the title of a 2010 biography of Armstrong by Terry Teachout.[93]\\nAfter a competition at the Savoy, he was crowned and nicknamed \"King Menelik,\" after the Emperor of Ethiopia, for slaying \"ofay jazz demons.\"[97]\\nArmstrong was largely accepted into white society, both on stage and off, a rarity for a black person at the time. Some musicians criticized Armstrong for playing in front of segregated audiences, and for not taking a strong enough stand in the American civil rights movement.[98] When he did speak out, it made national news, including his criticism of President Eisenhower, calling him \"two-faced\" and \"gutless\" because of his inaction during the conflict over school desegregation in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957. As a protest, Armstrong canceled a planned tour of the Soviet Union on behalf of the State Department saying: \"The way they\\'re treating my people in the South, the government can go to hell\" and that he could not represent his government abroad when it was in conflict with its own people.[99] The FBI kept a file on Armstrong for his outspokenness about integration.[100]\\nWhen asked about his religion, Armstrong answered that he was raised a Baptist, always wore a Star of David, and was friends with the pope.[101] He wore the Star of David in honor of the Karnoffsky family, who took him in as a child and lent him money to buy his first cornet. He was baptized a Catholic in the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church in New Orleans,[101] and he met Pope Pius XII and Pope Paul VI.[93]\\nArmstrong was concerned with his health. He used laxatives to control his weight, a practice he advocated both to acquaintances and in the diet plans he published under the title Lose Weight the Satchmo Way.[93]  Armstrong\\'s laxative of preference in his younger days was Pluto Water, but when he discovered the herbal remedy Swiss Kriss, he became an enthusiastic convert,[93] extolling its virtues to anyone who would listen and passing out packets to everyone he encountered, including members of the British Royal Family. (Armstrong also appeared in humorous, albeit risqué, cards that he had printed to send out to friends; the cards bore a picture of him sitting on a toilet—as viewed through a keyhole—with the slogan \"Satch says, \\'Leave it all behind ya!\\'\")[102] The cards have sometimes been incorrectly described as ads for Swiss Kriss.[103] In a live recording of \"Baby, It\\'s Cold Outside\" with Velma Middleton, he changes the lyric from \"Put another record on while I pour\" to \"Take some Swiss Kriss while I pour.\"[104] His laxative use began as a child when his mother would collect dandelions and peppergrass around the railroad tracks to give to her children for their health.[105]\\nArmstrong was a heavy marijuana smoker for much of his life and spent nine days in jail in 1930 after being arrested for drug possession outside a club. He described marijuana as \"a thousand times better than whiskey\".[106]\\nThe concern with his health and weight was balanced by his love of food, reflected in such songs as \"Cheesecake\", \"Cornet Chop Suey\",[107] though \"Struttin\\' with Some Barbecue\" was written about a fine-looking companion, not about food.[108] He kept a strong connection throughout his life to the cooking of New Orleans, always signing his letters, \"Red beans and ricely yours ...\"[109]\\nA fan of Major League Baseball, he founded a team in New Orleans that was known as Raggedy Nine and transformed the team into his Armstrong\\'s \"Secret Nine Baseball\".[110]\\nArmstrong\\'s gregariousness extended to writing. On the road, he wrote constantly, sharing favorite themes of his life with correspondents around the world. He avidly typed or wrote on whatever stationery was at hand, recording instant takes on music, sex, food, childhood memories, his heavy \"medicinal\" marijuana use—and even his bowel movements, which he gleefully described.[111]\\nLouis Armstrong was not, as is often claimed, a Freemason. Although he is usually listed as being a member of Montgomery Lodge No. 18 (Prince Hall) in New York, no such lodge has ever existed. However, Armstrong stated in his autobiography that he was a member of the Knights of Pythias, which although real is not a Masonic group.[112]\\nDuring the krewe\\'s 1949 Mardi Gras parade, Armstrong presided as King of the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club, for which he was featured on the cover of Time Magazine.[113]\\nIn his early years, Armstrong was best known for his virtuosity with the cornet and trumpet. Along with his \"clarinet-like figurations and high notes in his cornet solos\",  he was also known for his \"intense rhythmic \\'swing\\', a complex conception involving ... accented upbeats, upbeat to downbeat slurring, and complementary relations among rhythmic patterns.\"[114] The most lauded recordings on which Armstrong plays trumpet include the Hot Five and Hot Seven sessions, as well as those of the Red Onion Jazz Babies. Armstrong\\'s improvisations, while unconventionally sophisticated for that era, were also subtle and highly melodic. The solo that Armstrong plays during the song \"Potato Head Blues\" has long been considered his best solo of that series.[93][115]\\nPrior to Armstrong, most collective ensemble playing in jazz, along with its occasional solos, simply varied the melodies of the songs. Armstrong was virtually the first to create significant variations based on the chord harmonies of the songs instead of merely on the melodies. This opened a rich field for creation and improvisation, and significantly changed the music into a soloist\\'s art form.[93]\\nOften, Armstrong re-composed pop-tunes he played, simply with variations that made them more compelling to jazz listeners of the era. At the same time, however, his oeuvre includes many original melodies, creative leaps, and relaxed or driving rhythms. Armstrong\\'s playing technique, honed by constant practice, extended the range, tone and capabilities of the trumpet. In his records, Armstrong almost single-handedly created the role of the jazz soloist, taking what had been essentially a collective folk music and turning it into an art form with tremendous possibilities for individual expression.[93]\\nArmstrong was one of the first artists to use recordings of his performances to improve himself. Armstrong was an avid audiophile. He had a large collection of recordings, including reel-to-reel tapes, which he took on the road with him in a trunk during his later career. He enjoyed listening to his own recordings, and comparing his performances musically. In the den of his home, he had the latest audio equipment and would sometimes rehearse and record along with his older recordings or the radio.[116]\\nAs his music progressed and popularity grew, his singing also became very important. Armstrong was not the first to record scat singing, but he was masterful at it and helped popularize it with the first recording on which he scatted, \"Heebie Jeebies\". At a recording session for Okeh Records, when the sheet music supposedly fell on the floor and the music began before he could pick up the pages, Armstrong simply started singing nonsense syllables while Okeh president E.A. Fearn, who was at the session, kept telling him to continue. Armstrong did, thinking the track would be discarded, but that was the version that was pressed to disc, sold, and became an unexpected hit. Although the story was thought to be apocryphal, Armstrong himself confirmed it in at least one interview as well as in his memoirs.[117] On a later recording, Armstrong also sang out \"I done forgot the words\" in the middle of recording \"I\\'m A Ding Dong Daddy From Dumas\".\\nSuch records were hits and scat singing became a major part of his performances. Long before this, however, Armstrong was playing around with his vocals, shortening and lengthening phrases, interjecting improvisations, using his voice as creatively as his trumpet.[93] Armstrong once told Cab Calloway that his scat style was derived \"from the Jews rockin\", an Orthodox Jewish style of chanting during prayer.[118][119]\\nArmstrong was a gifted composer who wrote more than fifty songs, some of which have become jazz standards (e.g. \"Gully Low Blues\", \"Potato Head Blues\" and \"Swing That Music\").\\nDuring his long career he played and sang with some of the most important instrumentalists and vocalists of the time; among them were Bing Crosby, Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Jimmie Rodgers, Bessie Smith and perhaps most famously Ella Fitzgerald. His influence upon Crosby is particularly important with regard to the subsequent development of popular music: Crosby admired and copied Armstrong, as is evident on many of his early recordings, notably \"Just One More Chance\" (1931).[93]  The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz describes Crosby\\'s debt to Armstrong in precise detail, although it does not acknowledge Armstrong by name:\\nCrosby ... was important in introducing into the mainstream of popular singing an Afro-American concept of song as a lyrical extension of speech ... His techniques—easing the weight of the breath on the vocal cords, passing into a head voice at a low register, using forward production to aid distinct enunciation, singing on consonants (a practice of black singers), and making discreet use of appoggiaturas, mordents, and slurs to emphasize the text—were emulated by nearly all later popular singers.Armstrong recorded two albums with Ella Fitzgerald: Ella and Louis, and Ella and Louis Again for Verve Records, with the sessions featuring the backing musicianship of the Oscar Peterson Trio and drummers Buddy Rich (on the first album), and Louie Bellson (on the second). Norman Granz then had the vision for Ella and Louis to record Porgy and Bess.\\nHis recordings for Columbia Records, Louis Armstrong Plays W.C. Handy (1954) and Satch Plays Fats (all Fats Waller tunes) (1955) were both being considered masterpieces, as well as moderately well selling. In 1961 the All Stars participated in two albums—The Great Summit and The Great Reunion (now together as a single disc) with Duke Ellington. The albums feature many of Ellington\\'s most famous compositions (as well as two exclusive cuts) with Duke sitting in on piano. His participation in Dave Brubeck\\'s high-concept jazz musical The Real Ambassadors (1963) was critically acclaimed, and features \"Summer Song\", one of Armstrong\\'s most popular vocal efforts.\\nIn 1964, his recording of the song \"Hello Dolly\" went to number one. An album of the same title was quickly created around the song, and also shot to number one (knocking The Beatles off the top of the chart). The album sold very well for the rest of the year, quickly going \"Gold\" (500,000). His performance of \"Hello Dolly\" won for best male pop vocal performance at the 1964 Grammy Awards.\\nArmstrong had nineteen \"Top Ten\" records[120] including \"Stardust\", \"What a Wonderful World\", \"When The Saints Go Marching In\", \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\", \"Ain\\'t Misbehavin\\'\", \"You Rascal You\", and \"Stompin\\' at the Savoy\". \"We Have All the Time in the World\" was featured on the soundtrack of the James Bond film On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service, and enjoyed renewed popularity in the UK in 1994 when it featured on a Guinness advertisement. It reached number 3 in the charts on being re-released.\\nIn 1964, Armstrong knocked The Beatles off the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart with \"Hello, Dolly!\", which gave the 63-year-old performer a U.S. record as the oldest artist to have a number one song. His 1964 song \"Bout Time\" was later featured in the film Bewitched.[93]\\nIn February 1968, he appeared with Lara Saint Paul on the Italian RAI television channel where he performed \"Grassa e Bella\", a track he sang in Italian for the Italian market and C.D.I. label.[121]\\nIn 1968, Armstrong scored one last popular hit in the United Kingdom with \"What a Wonderful World\", which topped the British charts for a month. Armstrong appeared on the October 28, 1970, Johnny Cash Show, where he sang Nat King Cole\\'s hit \"Ramblin\\' Rose\" and joined Cash to re-create his performance backing Jimmie Rodgers on \"Blue Yodel No. 9\".\\nArmstrong enjoyed many types of music, from blues to the arrangements of Guy Lombardo, to Latin American folksongs, to classical symphonies and opera. He incorporated influences from all these sources into his performances, sometimes to the bewilderment of fans who wanted him to stay in convenient narrow categories. Armstrong was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an early influence. Some of his solos from the 1950s, such as the hard rocking version of \"St. Louis Blues\" from the WC Handy album, show that the influence went in both directions.[93]\\nArmstrong appeared in more than a dozen Hollywood films, usually playing a bandleader or musician. His most familiar role was as the bandleader cum narrator in the 1956 musical High Society starring Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Celeste Holm. He appears throughout the film, also sings the title song as well as performs a duet with Crosby, \"Now You Has Jazz\".[122] In 1947, he played himself in the movie New Orleans opposite Billie Holiday, which chronicled the demise of the Storyville district and the ensuing exodus of musicians from New Orleans to Chicago. In the 1959 film The Five Pennies he played himself, sang, and played several classic numbers. With Danny Kaye he performed a duet of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" during which Kaye impersonated Armstrong. He had a part in the film alongside James Stewart in The Glenn Miller Story.\\nIn 1937, Armstrong was the first African American to host a nationally broadcast radio show.[123] In 1969, he had a cameo role in Gene Kelly\\'s film version of Hello, Dolly! as the bandleader Louis. He sang the title song with actress Barbra Streisand. His solo recording of \"Hello, Dolly!\" is one of his most recognizable performances.[93] He was heard on such radio programs as The Story of Swing (1937) and This Is Jazz (1947), and he also made television appearances, especially in the 1950s and 1960s, including appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.[93]\\nArgentine writer Julio Cortázar, a self-described Armstrong admirer, asserted that a 1952 Louis Armstrong concert at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris played a significant role in inspiring him to create the fictional creatures called Cronopios that are the subject of a number of Cortázar\\'s short stories. Cortázar once called Armstrong himself \"Grandísimo Cronopio\" (The Great Cronopio).[93]\\nThere is a pivotal scene in Stardust Memories (1980) in which Woody Allen is overwhelmed by a recording of Armstrong\\'s \"Stardust\" and experiences a nostalgic epiphany.[124]\\nAgainst his doctor\\'s advice, Armstrong played a two-week engagement in March 1971 at the Waldorf-Astoria\\'s Empire Room. At the end of it, he was hospitalized for a heart attack.[125] He was released from the hospital in May, and quickly resumed practicing his trumpet playing. Still hoping to get back on the road, Armstrong died of a heart attack in his sleep on July 6, 1971, a month before his 70th birthday.[126]  He was residing in Corona, Queens, New York City, at the time of his death.[127] He was interred in Flushing Cemetery, Flushing, in Queens, New York City.\\nHis honorary pallbearers included Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Pearl Bailey, Count Basie, Harry James, Frank Sinatra, Ed Sullivan, Earl Wilson, Alan King, Johnny Carson and David Frost.[128] Peggy Lee sang The Lord\\'s Prayer at the services while Al Hibbler sang \"Nobody Knows the Trouble I\\'ve Seen\" and Fred Robbins, a long-time friend, gave the eulogy.[129]\\nArmstrong was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1972 by the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. This Special Merit Award is presented by vote of the Recording Academy\\'s National Trustees to performers who, during their lifetimes, have made creative contributions of outstanding artistic significance to the field of recording.[130]\\nRecordings of Armstrong were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least 25 years old, and that have \"qualitative or historical significance\".[131][132]\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listed Armstrong\\'s West End Blues on the list of 500 songs that shaped Rock and Roll.[133]\\nIn 1995, the U.S. Post Office issued a Louis Armstrong 32 cents commemorative postage stamp.\\nIn 1999 Armstrong was nominated for inclusion in the American Film Institute\\'s 100 Years ... 100 Stars.[135]\\nThe influence of Armstrong on the development of jazz is virtually immeasurable. His irrepressible personality both as a performer and as a public figure was so strong that to some it sometimes overshadowed his contributions as a musician and singer.\\nAs a virtuoso trumpet player, Armstrong had a unique tone and an extraordinary talent for melodic improvisation. Through his playing, the trumpet emerged as a solo instrument in jazz and is used widely today. Additionally, jazz itself was transformed from a collectively improvised folk music to a soloist\\'s serious art form largely through his influence. He was a masterful accompanist and ensemble player in addition to his extraordinary skills as a soloist. With his innovations, he raised the bar musically for all who came after him.\\nThough Armstrong is widely recognized as a pioneer of scat singing, Ethel Waters precedes his scatting on record in the 1930s according to Gary Giddins and others.[136] Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra are just two singers who were greatly indebted to him. Holiday said that she always wanted Bessie Smith\\'s \\'big\\' sound and Armstrong\\'s feeling in her singing. Even special musicians like Duke Ellington have praised Armstrong through strong testimonials. Duke Ellington, DownBeat magazine in 1971, said, \"If anybody was a master, it was Louis Armstrong. He was and will continue to be the embodiment of jazz.\"[137] In 1950, Bing Crosby, the most successful vocalist of the first half of the 20th century, said, \"He is the beginning and the end of music in America.\"[138]\\nIn the summer of 2001, in commemoration of the centennial of Armstrong\\'s birth, New Orleans\\'s main airport was renamed Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport.\\nIn 2002, the Louis Armstrong\\'s Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings (1925–1928) were preserved in the United States National Recording Registry, a registry of recordings selected yearly by the National Recording Preservation Board for preservation in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.[139]\\nThe US Open tennis tournament\\'s former main stadium was named Louis Armstrong Stadium in honor of Armstrong who had lived a few blocks from the site.[140]\\nCongo Square was a common gathering place for African-Americans in New Orleans for dancing and performing music. The park where Congo Square is located was later renamed Louis Armstrong Park.[141] Dedicated in April 1980, the park includes a 12-foot statue of Armstrong, trumpet in hand.[142]\\nThe house where Armstrong lived for almost 28 years was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1977 and is now a museum. The Louis Armstrong House Museum, at 34-56 107th Street between 34th and 37th avenues in Corona, Queens, presents concerts and educational programs, operates as a historic house museum and makes materials in its archives of writings, books, recordings and memorabilia available to the public for research. The museum is operated by the Queens College, City University of New York, following the dictates of Lucille Armstrong\\'s will. The museum opened to the public on October 15, 2003. A new visitors center is planned.[143]\\nAccording to literary critic Harold Bloom, \"The two great American contributions to the world\\'s art, in the end, are Walt Whitman and, after him, Armstrong and jazz ... If I had to choose between the two, ultimately, I wouldn\\'t. I would say that the genius of this nation at its best is indeed Walt Whitman and Louis Armstrong.\"[144]\\nOn June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Louis Armstrong among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.[145]\\n'}\n"
